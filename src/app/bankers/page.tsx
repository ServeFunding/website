const bankerFaqs = [
  {
    q: "Will my client switch their depository relationship to a different bank?",
    a: "No. Serve Funding is a financing advisory, not a bank. We don't take deposits, we don't open operating accounts, and we don't compete with you for the relationship. Your depository, treasury, ACH, payroll, and FX business all stay where they are. The only new account that gets opened in a typical placement is a lockbox or DACA account at the alternative lender's bank — and that account specifically serves the AR-collateralized facility. Your operating account is untouched.",
  },
  {
    q: "Do you pay banker referral fees?",
    a: "No. We don't pay bankers for referrals. Most banks don't allow it under their compliance policies, and even where it would be permissible, paying for referrals introduces a misalignment we don't want. The benefit of referring to us is structural: your client gets credit they couldn't get at the bank, you stay the hero of the relationship, the depository business doesn't go to a competing bank, and the client comes back to you cleaner and more bankable when the trajectory allows it.",
  },
  {
    q: "What happens to my client after I refer them?",
    a: "We take a 20-minute discovery call to map the situation — collateral position, revenue trajectory, use of funds, timing. We tell the client honestly which path fits (often two or three layered products). We shop the deal across our 30+ lender network — asset-based lenders, factors, equipment specialists, SBA partners, real estate lenders. We come back to the client with two or three real options to choose from. You're kept in the loop throughout if the client wants you in the loop; we don't run separately from the banking relationship.",
  },
  {
    q: "When will my client be bankable again?",
    a: "Depends on what got them declined and what we put in place. A factoring or asset-based facility used to bridge slow AR while the business cleans up its tax returns typically produces a bankable profile within 12 to 24 months. An MCA consolidation refinance into a term loan is often a longer arc — 18 to 36 months. A real-estate cash-out for working capital can pencil out to bankable inside a year. The point is we're not trying to keep your client off your bank line forever; we're stabilizing them so they can come back to you.",
  },
  {
    q: "What kind of deals do you actually do?",
    a: "Revenue range $500K to $100MM+, with most placements between $2MM and $50MM in revenue. Deal sizes $250K to $100MM+. Products: invoice factoring, asset-based lending, working capital loans, equipment financing, purchase order funding, government contract financing, bridge capital, SBA (referred through specialty non-bank SBA lenders), real estate cash-out, MCA consolidation. Industries: staffing, manufacturing, healthcare supply, government contractors, construction, distribution, professional services, e-commerce. Channel-neutral, product-neutral — we shop whichever lender fits the situation, not whichever pays us the most.",
  },
  {
    q: "What kind of deals do you not do?",
    a: "Pure equity rounds (we refer out to capital advisors). Consumer-facing lending. Cannabis. Crypto-specific. Anything where the business doesn't have at least $500K in trailing revenue or a clear path to it. Deals where the client is unwilling to put up any collateral, has no PG-creditworthy owner, and has thin revenue — we'll tell them honestly that none of our network will write it. We say no plainly when no is the right answer.",
  },
  {
    q: "What do I tell my client when I refer them?",
    a: 'Something like: "Our credit team can\'t get this done in our box, but I know a financing advisory that works with bankers exactly like us. They\'ll shop the deal across 30+ alternative lenders and bring back honest options. They don\'t take your deposits — your accounts stay with us — and they\'ve been doing this 20+ years. The first call is 20 minutes and they\'ll tell you straight whether they can help. Here\'s the link." Then send servefunding.com/discover or servefunding.com/bankers (whichever feels right). We take it from there.',
  },
  {
    q: "How fast do you fund?",
    a: "Depends on the product. Working capital loans and bridge capital fund in 2 to 10 business days. Invoice factoring closes in 2 to 3 weeks (then 24–48 hours per invoice after). Asset-based lending takes 4 to 8 weeks. Government contract financing 10 to 20 business days. SBA 4 to 12 weeks (we refer those to non-bank SBA lenders). When timing is genuinely critical we can usually find a bridge structure that funds in days while a permanent facility closes in the background.",
  },
  {
    q: "Who's actually doing the work — Mike or an intake person?",
    a: "Mike Kodinsky personally handles initial discovery on every banker-referred deal. After the discovery call, depending on the product complexity, he may bring in additional team members for placement and closing — but the relationship stays with him. We're deliberately a small boutique because the relationship-driven approach doesn't scale through a call center. We've turned down hiring expansions specifically to keep that hands-on character.",
  },
  {
    q: "Can I just send my client to your discovery form?",
    a: "Yes. The fastest path is servefunding.com/discover. Mention you're a banker referral and we'll prioritize the discovery call. If you'd prefer to make a warm introduction over email, michael@servefunding.com goes straight to Mike — happy to coordinate a three-way call if that fits the situation better than a hand-off.",

              Most commercial bankers turn down 30–40% of their loan requests for credit-box reasons even when the underlying business is sound — thin DSCR, tax returns that don&apos;t yet reflect current revenue, leverage from a recent acquisition, industry concentration the bank can&apos;t take. The credit need is real. Your client knows it&apos;s real. And right now your client is one Google search away from a financing broker who&apos;ll pitch them an MCA at a 1.4 factor rate and quietly try to move the depository over the next twelve months.

              The alternative is a referral to an advisor whose business model depends on never threatening yours. That&apos;s how Serve Funding works. We exist downstream of your decline. The client gets credit; you stay the hero; the operating account stays with you; and 12 to 36 months later, when the trajectory has cleaned up the financials, the client comes back to your credit team in a position to qualify.

            <Text className="text-gray-700 mb-6">
              Mike Kodinsky came up on the direct-lender side. For years he was the person bankers referred their declined clients to — running asset-based deals out of one specific credit box. That experience is what built Serve Funding, and it&apos;s the reason banker referrals are at the center of how we operate today.

              <Text className="text-gray-800 italic mb-3">
                &ldquo;David Phillips and I — we were competitors at one time. I was doing very much what he was doing on the asset-based side, and we would get referrals from bankers primarily. I did a study at one point, looked back two years, and figured out we were closing one deal out of every 15 or 16 looks we got. And the problem with that wasn&apos;t so much the closing ratio — sales is sales, it&apos;s always going to be a numbers game. It was the fact that on so many of those other ones we didn&apos;t end up closing, we still <em>thought</em> we had a deal, and we went down the road and spent time — which is to say, spent the client&apos;s time, and our own time — only to hit a wall later.&rdquo;

            <Text className="text-gray-700 mb-6">
              That experience is what turned Mike into a channel-neutral, product-neutral advisor. When the only product in your bag is asset-based lending, every client&apos;s situation has to fit asset-based lending — and you spend weeks of the client&apos;s time before you find out it doesn&apos;t. The job of a real advisor is to triage the situation across <em>every</em> product available, not to force the situation into the one product you happen to sell.
            </Text>
            <Text className="text-gray-700">
              For a referring banker, this matters in one concrete way: when you send a client to Serve Funding, the client&apos;s time is the resource we&apos;re most protective of. If we can&apos;t place the deal, we say so on the discovery call rather than after three weeks of underwriting. The banker who sent the referral never has to apologize to their client for the wasted process — which is the outcome that quietly kills banker-referral relationships across this industry.

              We can do meaningfully smaller and meaningfully larger than the sweet spot. We&apos;ve closed $250K factoring lines and $50MM ABL facilities in the same year. The sweet spot is just the range where the structural fit is cleanest and the timeline to bankability is most predictable.

You stay in the driver&apos;s seat on whether and when to re-open the bank credit conversation. If Serve Funding ever has to decline a referred deal we couldn&apos;t place, the same courtesy: a short written summary back to you so you know exactly where the client landed and why.</Text>

You cannot make more — everything else in the world, you can make more of, but not time. It&apos;s part of my talk track to bankers, because the worst outcome for a banker referral is when the client wastes three weeks with the wrong advisor and comes back angry. We&apos;d rather tell a client honestly on the first call that we can&apos;t help than spend their time pretending we can.&rdquo;

I want to introduce you to a financing advisory we&apos;ve worked with before.

They don&apos;t take deposits, so your accounts stay with us.
