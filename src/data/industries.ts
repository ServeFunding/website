    excerpt: "Staffing agencies run a weekly payroll against customers who pay net-30 to net-60+. Here is the funding logic that actually closes that gap.",
    hook: "You pay your people every Friday. Your customers pay you in 45 days. That math is the entire problem — and the entire reason invoice factoring exists.",
    image: "/blog/staffing-rbf-vs-factoring.webp",
    introduction:
      "Staffing is the textbook factoring industry. The mechanics are simple and they have been the same for decades: you bill a customer net-30 or net-60, your placements expect to be paid that week, and someone has to hold the cash in between. Invoice factoring is the product that was built to solve exactly that gap. The typical structure is an 85%–90% advance against eligible AR, factor fees of roughly 1%–2% per month the invoice is outstanding, and funding in 24–48 hours after onboarding. Approval generally lands in three to four weeks once a clean AR aging and a top customer list are in hand.\n\nThe right way to think about a factoring line is that it grows with you. It is not a fixed-amount loan. As your weekly billings climb, the availability climbs with them. We have seen agencies start at a $500K facility and scale past $5MM inside a year because that is how the product is designed — it tracks the sales, not the balance sheet. That is also why factoring tolerates the kind of tax returns that make a bank squint. The lender is underwriting your customers' credit, not yours.\n\nAt scale, the conversation usually shifts from factoring to asset-based lending. ABL is factoring's close cousin — same lockbox mechanics, same AR collateral — but it sits on the balance sheet as debt and prices cheaper, typically Prime + 1–4%. Most ABL desks start at $3MM minimums, which is why the cleanest move is to factor first, build a couple of years of clean reporting, then graduate. The other common layer is a revenue-based working capital loan sitting subordinate to the factoring line — useful when you have a payroll spike that runs ahead of billings, like onboarding a new shift or a new contract.\n\nWhat staffing usually does *not* need: MCAs. The product fit is so clean for factoring that taking a daily-debit advance to bridge payroll is almost always the wrong call. If the AR is there, factor it.",

      "A $4MM commercial staffing agency, paying weekly across roughly 80 placements at large logistics customers, has $600K–$700K of AR open at any time on net-45 terms. Payroll runs about $55K per week. The bank has them on a $250K line of credit that is permanently maxed and gets renewed reluctantly. Tax returns show $80K of net income against $4MM in revenue, which makes every bank conversation slow.\n\nThe structure is a $1MM revolving factoring line at an 88% advance rate, factor fee of 1.5% per month, no personal guarantee on the facility itself. Approval runs about three weeks. Once onboarded, the agency uploads invoices into the factor's portal, the factor advances 88% the next business day, and the remaining 12% (less the factor fee) is released when the customer pays. The factor sets up a lockbox in the agency's name so the customer relationship doesn't change.\n\nThe outcome: weekly payroll is no longer a fire drill — there is roughly $600K of immediate availability against current AR on day one. Six months in, the agency takes on a new logistics contract that adds $1.5MM of annual revenue and the line scales with it. Eighteen months in, with cleaner financials, the conversation shifts to converting to an ABL structure at Prime + 2%.",

        answer:
          "From clean docs to first funding is typically three to four weeks. Underwriting wants the last two years of financials, a recent AR aging, a customer list with credit profile, and your articles.

        question: "Will my customers know I'm factoring my invoices?",
        answer:
          "Yes — and that is by design, not by accident. The factor sends a one-time notification of assignment letter to your customer's AP department telling them where to send payment, and they will usually verify the invoice on the front end of the relationship. After that it is a quiet operational change. In staffing this is so common that most enterprise AP departments process notice-of-assignment letters as routine paperwork."
      },
      {
        question: "What advance rate should I expect for a staffing factoring line?",
        answer:
          "Typically 85%–90% of the eligible AR balance, with 90% as a common ceiling for clean staffing books. The 10%–15% holdback is released, less the factor fee, when your customer pays. Ineligibility usually means invoices over 60 to 90 days past due — those get pulled out of the borrowing base because the lender can't count on collection."
      },
      {
        question: "Is factoring a sign that my business is in trouble?",
        answer:
          "In staffing, no — it is closer to standard operating equipment. Factoring exists because the timing gap between weekly payroll and net-45 customer payment is structural, not a sign of distress. Bank lines simply do not size to weekly payroll demand the way factoring does. The companies using factoring are usually the ones growing fastest."
      },
      {
        question: "When do we graduate from factoring to ABL?",
        answer:
          "Usually somewhere between $5MM and $15MM in annual revenue, paired with two years of clean financials and a CFO or controller in seat. ABL prices cheaper — Prime + 1–4% versus the all-in cost of factoring — but most ABL desks start at $3MM minimum facility size, which is why factoring is almost always the first step. We can run the math on the breakpoint when the time comes."
      },
      {
        question: "Can a staffing agency with stacked MCAs still get a factoring line?",
        answer:
          "Sometimes — but the MCAs almost always have to be retired in the same transaction. Most factors will not advance behind a daily-debit lender because the debits compete with the lockbox for cash. The structure is usually: factoring line closes, advance is sized to pay off the MCAs at closing, and you exit the daily-debit cycle on day one. We will be honest with you about whether the math works before you spend the diligence cycle."
      },
      {
        question: "How is factoring priced compared to a working capital loan?",
        answer:
          "Factor fees typically run 1%–2% per month an invoice is outstanding, so on a net-45 book the effective cost is roughly 1.5%–3% of invoice value. That is more expensive than an ABL line (Prime + 1–4%) and cheaper than a fast working capital loan (1.25%–4% per month). The right product is usually the one that matches the cash flow shape: factoring tracks AR, working capital tracks revenue, ABL is the cheaper version of factoring once you can qualify."

    title: "Healthcare Financing: Medical AR Factoring & ABL",
    excerpt: "Healthcare funding splits into two products. Medical AR factoring (insurance receivables) is its own specialty. Supply and equipment use standard tools.",
    hook: "If you bill insurance, your funding options are smaller and more specialized than you'd guess. If you bill businesses, the standard playbook applies.",
    image: "/blog/Meeting 3.webp",
    introduction:
      "Healthcare is two different funding worlds inside one industry, and the first question we ask is which side you live on. If your receivable is owed by an insurance company, Medicare, Medicaid, or a managed care plan, you are in medical AR factoring territory — a specialized product. If your receivable is owed by a hospital, a clinic, a distributor, or another business, you are in standard B2B factoring or ABL territory. The product fit, the pricing, and the lender universe are different.\n\nMedical AR factoring exists because of one structural fact: insurers will not assign payment to a third party. They have to pay you. So instead of a true assignment, the lender sets up a DACA — a deposit account control agreement — where the account is in your name but the lender has visibility and sweep authority. Advance rates are lower than commercial factoring, typically 65%–75% rather than 85%–90%, because insurance reimbursement is uncertain (the provider often collects 40–60 cents on the dollar of billed charges, and that variability has to be priced in). Pricing runs around 2% per month. The universe of lenders is small — out of roughly 700 factoring companies in the U.S., only 10–15 actually do medical. That scarcity is exactly why advisors matter here.\n\nHealthcare supply companies, home health agencies that bill private pay, medical device distributors, equipment providers — these run on standard commercial AR. The factoring product looks like staffing's: 85%–90% advance, lockbox, scaling line. Equipment financing covers capital purchases (imaging, infusion, mobile units, fleet) on 60–84 month terms at single-digit to low-double-digit rates. Larger healthcare supply businesses with inventory plus AR plus equipment usually graduate to ABL.\n\nThe right move depends entirely on the receivable mix. We ask first, then recommend.",

They also hold roughly $700K in inventory at cost — proprietary disposables and a handful of consigned units at customer sites. The bank line is $400K and capped. They have one large new customer (a regional hospital network) waiting on a $1.2MM PO that will ship in tranches over six months.\n\nThe structure is a $1.5MM AR-based facility at an 88% advance rate, plus a $500K inventory sublimit at 50% advance on finished goods at cost. Pricing comes in around Prime + 3.5% on the AR portion. To bridge the production cycle on the hospital network PO, we lay in a separate PO financing facility that pays the manufacturer directly for 80% of the cost — settled when the invoice gets factored into the AR line on shipment.\n\nThe outcome: working AR availability roughly triples versus the old bank line.

    title: "Manufacturing Financing: ABL, PO Funding & Equipment",
    excerpt: "Manufacturers usually have AR, inventory, and equipment all on one balance sheet. That collateral mix is exactly what ABL was built to leverage.",
    hook: "When a manufacturer needs capital, the question is rarely 'which product?' — it's 'how do we stack three products against four collateral types into one facility?'",
    image: "/blog/Walking.webp",
    introduction:
      "Manufacturing is where the asset-based playbook really shines, because you usually have more than one collateral type on the balance sheet. There's AR from your commercial customers, inventory at cost (raw materials, work-in-process, and finished goods), equipment you own free-and-clear or partly financed, and sometimes real estate. ABL was built for exactly this picture: a single revolving line that advances against the whole stack — typically 80%–90% on AR, 50%–60% on inventory, plus an equipment and sometimes real estate piece. Facility sizes generally start at $3MM and run up to $25MM and beyond, priced at Prime + 1–4%, with funding in 6–8 weeks once full diligence runs.\n\nUnder the ABL minimum threshold, the default is invoice factoring on the AR alone, typically with an inventory sublimit added on a case-by-case basis. There are also a handful of specialty inventory lenders who will do standalone deals — usually two or three lenders we know of will advance roughly 40%–50% of inventory at cost, on top of a 13-week cash flow forecast and a math story (not a sales story) for how the inventory turns. That product is harder to source and pricier than ABL, but it can be the right answer when AR is too lumpy to anchor a deal.\n\nWhen a large purchase order lands — especially one with international suppliers, long lead times, or tariff exposure — PO funding becomes the right tool. PO funding pays your vendors for 70%–100% of confirmed order cost at roughly 1.5%–3% per 30 days.

The current bank has them on a $1.5MM line, capped, with a personal guarantee and a tight DSCR covenant. A new customer just placed a $2.4MM purchase order requiring 90 days of production cash and imported components.\n\nThe structure is a $6MM asset-based facility — 85% advance on eligible AR, 55% advance on finished goods inventory, plus a $750K equipment add-on. Pricing comes in at Prime + 2.5%. The bank is paid out at closing and walks away from the covenant. To bridge the new customer's $2.4MM PO, a separate PO facility funds the overseas supplier for 80% of cost at 2% per 30 days; once the goods ship and the invoice generates, the AR line picks up the receivable and the PO facility self-liquidates.\n\nThe outcome: total revolving availability roughly triples versus the old bank line. The $2.4MM order ships on time without the manufacturer touching equity capital. Eighteen months in, with revenue at $18MM, the facility resizes to $10MM at slightly tighter pricing and the equipment add-on is rolled into a separate term structure for tax efficiency.",

The difference is factoring isn't debt on your balance sheet — it's a recurring sale of an asset — while ABL is a true line of credit.

Once you ship the goods and invoice the customer, the factoring line (or ABL line) advances against the new receivable and uses that advance to pay off the PO facility.

They typically advance 40%–50% on inventory at cost (a perfect-world example would be 50%) and they require a 13-week cash flow forecast plus a math-driven explanation for how the inventory turns into cash.

        answer:

Real estate is always going to command the lowest rates because it's lenders' favorite asset from a security standpoint — it's not going anywhere and it generally appreciates.

The right structure is usually a partnership: the bank keeps the depository and treasury relationship, an asset-based or factoring lender handles the credit need that falls outside the bank's box, and the manufacturer ends up better served than either lender could deliver alone. Most of our manufacturing deals start with a banker referral and the depository relationship stays with the bank throughout."

    image: "/blog/Meeting 4.webp",
    introduction:
      "Government contractors live with a particular tension: your customer's creditworthiness is essentially perfect, and your payment cycle is essentially terrible. Net-30 turns into net-60 turns into net-90 once you factor in invoice processing, prime-to-sub flow, and the occasional government shutdown. The right product is a specialized variant of factoring — government contract financing — that advances up to 90% of contract value, prices at Prime + 2–8%, and funds in 10–20 business days. It's a cousin to commercial factoring but underwritten differently, because the lender is reading the contract itself, not just your AR aging.\n\nThis matters most for subcontractors. If you're a sub waiting on a prime to get paid by the government, standard commercial factoring often will not touch the deal — too many handoffs, too much dependency on someone else's paperwork. Specialized contract financing reads through that structure and underwrites against the underlying federal, state, or local award. Subs on GSA, DoD, and state contracts who can't get conventional factoring can usually get this.\n\nDeals run from $250K up to $50MM and beyond. Approval typically lands in 5–10 business days, funding inside 20. Retainage structures (where the government holds back 5%–10% of contract value until completion) are common and lenders price for them; they do not break the deal but they do tighten the borrowing base. We also see prime contractors on long-cycle awards layer in bridge capital and equipment financing for the upfront materials and labor before the first invoice generates.\n\nFor smaller contractors, a revenue-based working capital line sometimes makes more sense than contract factoring — it's faster, it's cheaper for short bursts, and it doesn't require the contract assignment paperwork. The cleanest answer depends on the size of the award, how long the cycle is, and how clean the contract documentation reads.",

        answer:
          "Two reasons. First, the lender underwrites the contract itself — the agency, the task order, the assignment paperwork — not just your AR aging. Second, federal contracts require a formal Assignment of Claims Act filing for the lender to receive payment directly. Standard factors often don't have the infrastructure for that.

          "Often, yes — through specialized contract financing rather than standard commercial factoring. The lender reads through to the prime's contract with the government and structures around that. Most commercial factors won't take a sub-tier position because there are too many points of failure in the payment chain. The specialty lenders are built for it."
      },
      {

        answer:
          "Up to 90% of contract value on strong federal and state awards, sometimes a bit lower for smaller agencies or longer cycles. Pricing runs Prime + 2–8% depending on contract type, term, and your performance history. Approval is generally 5–10 business days; funding inside 20 once the assignment paperwork is in place."
      },
      {
        question: "How does retainage affect the facility?",
        answer:
          "Retainage — the 5%–10% the government withholds until contract completion — usually gets excluded from the borrowing base while it sits in retention. It is not lost, but it's not financeable until it's released. Lenders price the rest of the contract accounting for the retention, so a 10% retainage facility on a $2MM contract effectively works against $1.8MM of borrowing base."
      },
      {
        question: "What happens to my facility during a government shutdown?",
        answer:
          "It depends on the lender. Specialized contract financiers tend to ride through short shutdowns — they know the payment will resume — and adjust the eligible AR aging buckets accordingly. Some lenders will allow extensions on past-due invoices specifically for shutdown-related delays. The conversation we always have on the front end is what happens if payment stretches past 90 days for reasons unrelated to your performance."
      },
      {
        question: "Can I layer in bridge capital for mobilization on a new task order?",
        answer:
          "Yes — and it's a common move. Bridge funding closes in days, sized for upfront materials, labor, and mobilization, then exits as soon as the contract financing line picks up the first invoice. Interest-only structures are typical, with aggressive early-payoff discounts so you only pay for the days you actually use the capital."

    image: "/blog/Construciton meeting.webp",
    introduction:
      "Construction is where the layered-capital approach earns its keep. The cash flow has structural timing gaps in three places: progress billings (you bill against work completed, but payment lags by 30–60 days), retainage (5%–10% of contract value held back until completion, sometimes for months after substantial completion), and equipment carrying costs (the gear has to be on the job before the first dollar invoices). No single product solves all three. The right answer is usually a combination.\n\nThe primary tool for general contractors and subs with progress billings against commercial or government owners is AR-based financing — either standard factoring on the commercial side or government contract financing for federal, state, and local work. Advance rates land at 80%–90% on eligible billings, with retainage carved out of the borrowing base until release. Specialty trades — electrical, mechanical, framing, roofing, foundation — often start in factoring and graduate to ABL once revenue passes $5MM and financials clean up.\n\nEquipment financing is the second pillar. Construction is equipment-heavy by definition, and the right answer for capacity expansion is rarely a working-capital draw — it's a 60–84 month equipment loan or lease against the specific asset, often at single-digit to low-double-digit rates. Sale-leaseback is the move when you need to pull cash from gear you already own (free-and-clear loaders, trucks, tooling) without taking on a new bank covenant.\n\nBridge capital is the third pillar — short, interest-only money to cover bid-to-award timing gaps, mobilization, payroll bumps on a new contract, or to clean up a maxed bank line ahead of bonding renewals. Closes in days, typically exits in 6–12 months with aggressive early-payoff discounts. For contractors trapped in MCAs (a depressingly common situation when a slow quarter hits), debt refinancing is the path back to standard products.",

      "A specialty contractor with $4MM in revenue and a husband-and-wife ownership team carries $600K in progress billings on net-45 terms with two general contractors. The bank line is $250K and they just got notice it won't renew — the previous tax year showed a loss after one large dispute pushed an invoice past 90 days. They have $400K of free-and-clear equipment (loaders, trucks, a few specialty tools) and an upcoming bonding renewal that requires demonstrating working capital.\n\nThe structure layers three products. First, a $750K commercial factoring line at an 87% advance rate on eligible billings, retainage carved out until release; this clears the existing bank line at closing and gives ongoing working capital that tracks the AR. Second, a $250K sale-leaseback on the free-and-clear equipment over 48 months — pulls cash out of equity sitting on equipment that wasn't generating leverage. Third, a $150K bridge with aggressive early-payoff terms to clean up a pair of MCAs taken on during the previous slow quarter.\n\nThe outcome: monthly debt service drops sharply versus the pre-restructure picture because the MCA daily debits are gone. Working capital availability roughly triples. The bonding renewal lands clean. Twelve months later, with the factoring line seasoned and the books cleaner, the contractor refinances the sale-leaseback into a longer-term equipment note at a better rate.",

        question: "How does factoring work with progress billings?",
        answer:
          "The factor reads the contract and your billing schedule, advances 85%–90% against eligible invoices once the work is signed off, and carves retainage out of the borrowing base until it's released. Funding on a given accepted invoice is 24–48 hours. The lender will typically want to see the AIA forms (or your equivalent) and confirm acceptance with the GC or owner before funding the first time."
      },
      {
        question: "What happens to retainage in a factoring line?",
        answer:
          "Retainage isn't financeable while it's being held — the lender treats it as ineligible until it's released. So if your contracts have 10% retainage on a $1MM project, the lender is sizing the borrowing base off the $900K that's actually due, not the full $1MM. Once retainage releases at substantial completion, it flows through the lockbox normally and the holdback is refunded."

It's almost like you're selling the equipment to the lender and then leasing it back from them — just a fancy way of saying that's how you get cash out of it.

        answer:

When it does, the structure is usually a longer-term asset-based product (factoring against your billings, sale-leaseback against your equipment, or an ABL line if you're at the right size) that pays off the daily-debit advances at closing and replaces them with a single monthly payment. The path out is rarely in one leap — it's a few steps up the ladder, but moving in the right direction matters."

        question: "How does this interact with my bonding capacity?",
        answer:
          "Surety carriers care about working capital and net worth, not specifically how you finance your receivables. A factoring line that gives you predictable cash flow against your billings often improves your bonding picture because the working capital ratio cleans up.

    excerpt: "Without B2B invoices, classic factoring usually doesn't fit DTC. The real tools are inventory financing, revenue-based capital, and PO funding for big launches.",
    hook: "No B2B invoices means no factoring. The real DTC question is whether your capital need lives in inventory, in customer acquisition spend, or in supplier production.",
    image: "/blog/Cofee.webp",
    introduction:
      "Direct-to-consumer is the one industry on this list where invoice factoring usually doesn't fit. The reason is simple: you're selling to individuals, not to businesses, and there is no commercial receivable to advance against. Payments hit your Stripe or Shopify account in 1–3 days, which is great for cash flow but doesn't generate the kind of asset that a factoring line is built around. So the funding playbook is different — and the right tools are inventory financing, revenue-based working capital, and (for big production runs and international suppliers) PO funding.\n\nInventory financing is the closest analog to factoring for an inventory-heavy DTC brand. We know of a small handful of specialty lenders who do e-commerce inventory specifically — including one of our asset-based lenders who runs a standalone inventory financing program for e-commerce sellers. Structures look like a revolving line backed by inventory at cost, with advance rates typically 40%–50% on finished goods, and pricing landing in a Prime + 6–12% range. The lender wants senior position on inventory, a clear picture of how the goods move (Amazon FBA warehouses, 3PL inventory, on-site stock), and a math-backed forecast.\n\nRevenue-based working capital is the most common tool for DTC brands under $5MM in revenue or for brands whose inventory mix is too dispersed to anchor a true asset-based deal. It underwrites against historical Shopify, Amazon, or Stripe revenue, typically sizing the line at 10%–15% of trailing 12-month revenue. The best lenders price in the mid-teens APR — better than most people expect — and operate as a true revolving line where you pay it off and re-borrow. Weaker lenders (and most of the MCA universe) take a daily debit and structure as fixed-cost factor-rate advances; we're transparent about which is which and steer people away from the predatory end.\n\nPO funding kicks in for big production runs, international suppliers, and tariff-impacted launches — paying overseas factories 70%–100% of confirmed order cost so you don't have to burn equity capital on raw materials. The exit on a DTC PO deal usually isn't a factoring line (no B2B invoice) — it's the inventory financing facility once the goods land, or the revenue cycle once the launch hits market.",

      "No B2B receivables means classic invoice factoring usually isn't an option — the capital tools are inventory-based or revenue-based instead",
      "Inventory builds ahead of seasonal launches tie up significant working capital, especially with international suppliers and tariff exposure",
      "Customer acquisition spend on Meta, Google, and TikTok competes with inventory dollars for the same cash",
      "Amazon FBA and 3PL inventory complicates lender diligence because the goods are physically held by a third party",
      "Bank lines often don't size to DTC growth because the financials look unconventional (heavy ad spend, gross-margin variability, seasonal swings)",
      "Many DTC brands get pushed into MCAs because the speed of capital matches the speed of opportunity — but the daily debits crush the gross margin",
      "Returns and chargebacks create AR-like uncertainty that inventory lenders price for"

    workedExample:
      "A DTC beverage brand doing $7MM in trailing 12-month revenue on Shopify and Amazon carries about $1.2MM of inventory at cost — finished goods split between a 3PL warehouse in Pennsylvania and Amazon FBA. They have a Q4 launch coming up that requires producing 40% more units than usual, sourced overseas, with a tariff window that closes in 90 days. The bank declined working capital because the financials look unconventional (heavy ad spend, modest net income, seasonal swing).\n\nThe structure layers two products. First, a $600K inventory financing line at a 45% advance on finished goods at cost, with the 3PL signing a bailment letter giving the lender visibility into inventory at the warehouse; pricing comes in at Prime + 8%. Second, a $900K PO funding facility for the overseas production run, paying the supplier 80% of cost at 2.25% per 30 days, with the exit happening as the goods land and roll into the inventory facility.\n\nThe outcome: the Q4 launch ships on time, ahead of the tariff change, with the bulk-order discount more than offsetting the cost of the PO facility. The brand keeps its equity capital free for ad spend through the launch window. Twelve months later, with the inventory line seasoned and revenue at $11MM, the conversation shifts to whether a full ABL structure makes sense as the next step.",

      {
        question: "Why doesn't classic invoice factoring work for my DTC brand?",
        answer:
          "Because factoring advances against a B2B invoice — a commercial receivable owed by another business — and you're selling to individuals. When a customer buys through your Shopify checkout, the cash hits your account in 1–3 days. That's faster than any factor could advance, but it also means there's no aging receivable to finance. The exception is wholesale revenue, Amazon Vendor Central, or other true B2B channels you may have on top of your DTC business — those carry real commercial invoices and can be factored normally."

        answer:
          "A small specialty market. We know of a couple of ABL-style lenders running standalone e-commerce inventory programs — revolving lines at roughly 40%–50% advance on finished goods at cost, structured around senior position on inventory and a clear picture of how goods move through your 3PL or FBA. Pricing typically lands in a Prime + 6–12% range. The diligence is more involved than a working capital line because the lender needs visibility into inventory they often can't physically touch (FBA, 3PL)."

        answer:
          "The repayment structure and the true cost. A real working capital line — the kind we steer people toward — is a revolving facility with monthly payments at an APR in the mid-teens, sometimes pushing low 20s. An MCA is a fixed-cost advance with a daily or weekly debit and a true APR that can climb into the 50s or higher, sometimes triple digits on the worst end. We are transparent about which lender does which structure before any deal moves forward."
      },
      {
        question: "When does PO funding make sense for a DTC brand?",
        answer:
          "For large production runs with overseas suppliers, especially when there's a tariff window, a launch deadline, or a bulk-order discount that justifies the cost. The PO lender pays your supplier 70%–100% of confirmed order cost at roughly 1.5%–3% per 30 days, and the exit happens when the goods land and roll into your inventory financing facility (or, less cleanly, when the launch revenue comes in). It's a way to preserve your equity capital for ad spend through the launch."
      },
      {
        question: "I took on multiple MCAs to fund ad spend on a launch that didn't return. What now?",
        answer:
          "We start with honest assessment. Sometimes the math doesn't work and we'll tell you that — better to know early than spend three weeks chasing a deal that won't close. When it does work, the structure is usually a longer-term inventory-backed or revenue-based product that pays off the MCAs at closing and replaces them with one manageable monthly payment. The move out of MCAs is rarely one leap from the basement to the first floor — it's a few steps up the ladder, but the direction is what matters."
      },
      {
        question: "How fast can a revenue-based line close for a DTC brand?",
        answer:
          "Faster than most other products. A clean revenue-based working capital deal can close in days once the lender has bank statements, processor statements, and a basic data package. Inventory financing takes longer — typically 4 to 6 weeks because of the diligence involved in inventory visibility and 3PL or FBA structure. PO funding lands somewhere in between, usually 2 to 4 weeks for approval and 5–10 business days for first funding once the structure is in place."
      },
      {
        question: "Do I need wholesale revenue to qualify for anything besides revenue-based capital?",
        answer:
          "Not necessarily. Inventory financing underwrites against inventory at cost, regardless of whether you sell DTC or wholesale, so a pure DTC brand with $1MM+ of inventory can qualify on that basis. Wholesale revenue helps because it adds a commercial receivable component that some lenders like seeing, and at scale a hybrid DTC-plus-wholesale brand can qualify for ABL covering both inventory and AR in a single facility. The exact mix dictates the product fit."
