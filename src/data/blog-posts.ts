      { type: 'p', text: "Sometimes your banker comes back with one of these:" },
      { type: 'p', text: "→ \"Your DSCR is just below our threshold. Come back in 6 months.\"" },
      { type: 'p', text: "→ \"Your growth is too fast. We can't keep up with your needs.\"" },

      { type: 'p', text: "→ \"We've maxed out our exposure to your sector.\"" },

      { type: 'p', text: "\"We can get you approved and funded in 3 days,\" they say. \"No hassle. No complicated underwriting.\"" },
      { type: 'p', text: "You're tempted. Your banker took 5 months and said no. This lender is saying yes in 3 days." },
      { type: 'p', text: "What you don't realize: what sounds simple is actually predatory. The \"rates\" they quote don't include fees. The speed comes at a price. A high price." },
      { type: 'p', text: "By the time you realize the true cost, you've already signed. And now you're stuck in a debt cycle that's hard to escape." },
      { type: 'h3', text: "Path B: The Trusted Advisor (The Better One)" },
      { type: 'p', text: "Instead of Googling, you do something smarter: you ask." },
      { type: 'p', text: "You ask your banker: \"Who do you recommend when you can't help?\"" },
      { type: 'p', text: "Many times, your banker knows someone. They have relationships with alternative lenders or funding advisors. They've referred clients before. They know who operates with integrity." },
      { type: 'p', text: "This is a warm referral. Your banker is putting their reputation on the line by introducing you. That matters." },
      { type: 'p', text: "Or you ask your CPA, your fractional CFO, or your business advisor. They likely have recommendations too." },
      { type: 'p', text: "A good advisor comes with context: they understand your business, your goals, and your timeline. They ask questions BEFORE recommending a solution. They present OPTIONS instead of pushing a single product." },
      { type: 'p', text: "And crucially: they're transparent about what everything costs." },
      { type: 'h2', text: "The Real Question: Why Your Bank Said No Doesn't Mean No" },
      { type: 'p', text: "Here's something most business owners don't realize:" },
      { type: 'p', text: "When a traditional bank says no, it doesn't mean your business can't get funded. It means your business doesn't fit their specific credit box." },
      { type: 'p', text: "Banks operate within constraints:" },
      { type: 'p', text: "→ They need a minimum DSCR (usually 1.25x or higher)" },
      { type: 'p', text: "→ They require 2+ years in business (usually)" },
      { type: 'p', text: "→ They want established collateral" },
      { type: 'p', text: "→ They avoid certain industries" },
      { type: 'p', text: "→ They have regulatory constraints on how much they can lend to any one industry" },
      { type: 'p', text: "But alternative lenders operate differently. They look at:" },
      { type: 'p', text: "→ Accounts receivable quality (not just tax returns)" },
      { type: 'p', text: "→ Current business trajectory (not historical DSCR)" },
      { type: 'p', text: "→ Asset value (what you have RIGHT NOW, not what you refinanced)" },
      { type: 'p', text: "→ Revenue and growth rate (instead of industry avoidance)" },
      { type: 'p', text: "So when your bank says no, a good alternative lender often says yes. Not because they're reckless, but because they evaluate differently." },
      { type: 'h2', text: "How to Tell the Difference" },
      { type: 'p', text: "So how do you know if you're talking to a predatory lender or a trustworthy advisor?" },
      { type: 'p', text: "Ask these questions:" },
      { type: 'h3', text: "1. Do they ask questions or just sell?" },
      { type: 'p', text: "A good advisor asks: \"Tell me about your business. What are you trying to accomplish? What assets do you have? What's your timeline?\"" },
      { type: 'p', text: "A predatory lender rushes to the close: \"Here's what we can offer. Sign here.\"" },
      { type: 'h3', text: "2. Are they transparent about costs?" },
      { type: 'p', text: "A good advisor explains the all-in cost (APR) upfront. A predatory lender quotes a \"6% rate\" without explaining it's monthly, and hides fees in fine print." },
      { type: 'h3', text: "3. Do they present options or push one solution?" },
      { type: 'p', text: "A good advisor might say: \"Here's what we can do. But based on your situation, you might also consider this other option. Here's the cost difference.\"" },
      { type: 'p', text: "A predatory lender says: \"This is the only thing available. Take it or leave it.\"" },
      { type: 'h3', text: "4. Are they pressure salespeople or patient advisors?" },
      { type: 'p', text: "A good advisor respects your timeline: \"Take a few days. Think about it. We'll be here.\"" },
      { type: 'p', text: "A predatory lender creates urgency: \"This offer expires today. We need your decision now.\"" },
      { type: 'h2', text: "The Path Forward" },
      { type: 'p', text: "If your bank has already said no, don't despair. Don't panic into a predatory lender either." },
      { type: 'p', text: "Instead:" },
      { type: 'p', text: "1. Ask your banker for recommendations. Most have partners they trust." },
      { type: 'p', text: "2. Ask your CPA or CFO if they know good funding advisors." },
      { type: 'p', text: "3. Look for advisors who ask questions before recommending solutions." },
      { type: 'p', text: "4. Request transparency on all-in costs (APR, not just \"rates\")." },
      { type: 'p', text: "5. Take your time. Legitimate advisors don't pressure you." },

      { type: 'h2', text: "The Question That Matters Most" },
      { type: 'p', text: "One of the questions we receive most often is: 'What is the application process like for business financing, and how long will it take?'" },
      { type: 'p', text: "The honest answer is nuanced. It depends on what type of financing you need. How long you've been in business. What you're trying to accomplish. But we can give you clear timelines for each scenario." },
      { type: 'h2', text: "Scenario 1: Fast-Track Financing (1 Day to 1 Week)" },
      { type: 'p', text: "For businesses that need speed, short-term revenue-based bridge loans or quick-access lines of credit can move remarkably fast. Here's what the process looks like:" },
      { type: 'h3', text: "What You Need to Provide" },
      { type: 'p', text: "→ 3–6 months of recent bank statements" },
      { type: 'p', text: "→ One-page application (10 minutes to complete)" },
      { type: 'p', text: "→ Basic business information and owner details" },
      { type: 'h3', text: "What Happens Next" },
      { type: 'p', text: "You submit today. You get an answer within a day or two. If approved, you can be funded within days, sometimes within a week." },
      { type: 'h3', text: "How It Gets Structured" },
      { type: 'p', text: "These facilities come in two flavors:" },
      { type: 'p', text: "→ Lines of credit: Flexible. Draw what you need, when you need it. Pay back as customers pay." },
      { type: 'p', text: "→ Term products: Fixed amount. Fixed term. Deploy once, repay on schedule." },
      { type: 'h3', text: "The Size" },
      { type: 'p', text: "Facilities can range from $50,000 to several million—even up to $10MM depending on the lender and your specific situation." },
      { type: 'h3', text: "Why It's So Fast" },
      { type: 'p', text: "These lenders rely heavily on recent bank statements. They're looking at real cash flow and real transactions, not historical tax returns. That's why the process is so much faster than traditional lending." },
      { type: 'h2', text: "Scenario 2: Asset-Based Lending (4–8 Weeks)" },
      { type: 'p', text: "For businesses with substantial assets—accounts receivable, inventory, equipment, real estate—asset-based lending is the answer. The process is more thorough, but the capital available is substantially larger." },
      { type: 'h3', text: "What You Need to Provide" },
      { type: 'p', text: "→ Complete financial statements (recent and historical)" },
      { type: 'p', text: "→ Tax returns (usually 2–3 years)" },
      { type: 'p', text: "→ Detailed list of assets with values" },
      { type: 'p', text: "→ Breakdown of personal finances (likely)" },
      { type: 'p', text: "→ Appraisals or asset inspections (may be required)" },
      { type: 'h3', text: "What Happens Next" },
      { type: 'p', text: "The lender's underwriting team reviews everything. They assess collateral value. They analyze your cash flow. They may send an appraiser to inspect assets. This takes time—but it's thorough." },
      { type: 'h3', text: "Timeline Expectations" },
      { type: 'p', text: "→ 4–6 weeks if everything is clean and straightforward" },
      { type: 'p', text: "→ 6–8 weeks if there are complications or they need additional documentation" },
      { type: 'h3', text: "The Upside" },
      { type: 'p', text: "You get substantial capital. You get fixed rates. You get predictable terms. And because the loan is backed by real assets, you typically get better pricing than unsecured facilities." },
      { type: 'h2', text: "Scenario 3: SBA Loans (8–12 Weeks or More)" },
      { type: 'p', text: "For businesses seeking the lowest possible rates and longest possible terms, SBA loans are valuable. But they require patience." },
      { type: 'h3', text: "What You Need to Provide" },
      { type: 'p', text: "→ Full business plan and personal financial statement" },
      { type: 'p', text: "→ Extensive financial documentation (multiple years)" },
      { type: 'p', text: "→ Detailed use of funds explanation" },
      { type: 'p', text: "→ Collateral documentation" },
      { type: 'h3', text: "What Happens Next" },
      { type: 'p', text: "The SBA has specific underwriting standards. Your bank works through the SBA's process. This includes detailed review, verification, and compliance checking." },
      { type: 'h3', text: "Timeline Expectations" },
      { type: 'p', text: "→ 2–3 months is standard (not unusual)" },
      { type: 'p', text: "→ 4+ months if there are complications or questions that need clarification" },
      { type: 'h3', text: "The Value Proposition" },
      { type: 'p', text: "You get the lowest possible interest rates. You get long terms (up to 10 years). You get the backing of a federal guarantee. But you need patience and preparation." },
      { type: 'h2', text: "Why The Differences?" },
      { type: 'p', text: "The simple answer: faster funding requires different evaluation criteria. Fast-track lenders rely on behavioral data (your bank statements, your recent transactions). Asset-based lenders need appraisals and detailed collateral analysis. SBA lenders need compliance with federal programs." },
      { type: 'p', text: "There's a place for every type of loan product and credit structure. The key is matching your timeline and situation with the right solution." },
      { type: 'h2', text: "Which Path Is Right For You?" },
      { type: 'p', text: "Here's how to think about it:" },
      { type: 'p', text: "Need capital in days? → Fast-track revenue-based options" },
      { type: 'p', text: "Have 4–8 weeks and substantial assets? → Asset-based lending" },
      { type: 'p', text: "Can wait 2–3 months for the best rate? → SBA lending" },
      { type: 'p', text: "Each has tradeoffs. Speed vs rate. Flexibility vs predictability. Our job is helping you understand those tradeoffs and pick the right solution for your specific situation." },

      { type: 'p', text: "Short answer: Yes. You can. There are options." },
      { type: 'p', text: "Long answer: Are they limited? Are they difficult to find? Yes, for sure. Especially the no-revenue scenario. But they exist, and understanding them can be the difference between growth and being stuck." },

      { type: 'p', text: "If you have zero revenue, I won't sugarcoat it: it's harder than being less than a year in business. Why? Because no revenue implies you haven't really started producing your product or delivering your service yet. It's all potential. It's all planning. It's maybe a contract you have in place or a purchase order." },
      { type: 'p', text: "Most traditional lenders won't touch this. They can't measure cash flow because there is none. They can't reference historical performance because there is none." },

      { type: 'p', text: "→ Letters of intent from solid companies that represent real future revenue" },
      { type: 'p', text: "These aren't maybes. They're contractual obligations. Real future revenue. And some lenders will finance against them to help you fulfill the contract or PO." },

      { type: 'p', text: "Here's what we've learned: just because you're new doesn't mean capital isn't available. It means you need to present your situation the right way. You need to show:" },
