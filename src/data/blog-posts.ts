      { type: 'p', text: "Sometimes your banker comes back with one of these:" },
      { type: 'p', text: "→ \"Your DSCR is just below our threshold. Come back in 6 months.\"" },
      { type: 'p', text: "→ \"Your growth is too fast. We can't keep up with your needs.\"" },

      { type: 'p', text: "→ \"We've maxed out our exposure to your sector.\"" },

      { type: 'p', text: "At this point, most business owners panic a little." },
      { type: 'p', text: "You need money. You need it relatively soon. And your first choice (the bank) just said no." },

      { type: 'p', text: "\"We can get you approved and funded in 3 days,\" they say. \"No hassle. No complicated underwriting.\"" },
      { type: 'p', text: "You're tempted. Your banker took 5 months and said no. This lender is saying yes in 3 days." },
      { type: 'p', text: "What you don't realize: what sounds simple is actually predatory. The \"rates\" they quote don't include fees. The speed comes at a price. A high price." },
      { type: 'p', text: "By the time you realize the true cost, you've already signed. And now you're stuck in a debt cycle that's hard to escape." },
      { type: 'h3', text: "Path B: The Trusted Advisor (The Better One)" },
      { type: 'p', text: "Instead of Googling, you do something smarter: you ask." },
      { type: 'p', text: "You ask your banker: \"Who do you recommend when you can't help?\"" },
      { type: 'p', text: "Many times, your banker knows someone. They have relationships with alternative lenders or funding advisors. They've referred clients before. They know who operates with integrity." },
      { type: 'p', text: "This is a warm referral. Your banker is putting their reputation on the line by introducing you. That matters." },
      { type: 'p', text: "Or you ask your CPA, your fractional CFO, or your business advisor. They likely have recommendations too." },
      { type: 'p', text: "A good advisor comes with context: they understand your business, your goals, and your timeline. They ask questions BEFORE recommending a solution. They present OPTIONS instead of pushing a single product." },
      { type: 'p', text: "And crucially: they're transparent about what everything costs." },
      { type: 'h2', text: "The Real Question: Why Your Bank Said No Doesn't Mean No" },
      { type: 'p', text: "Here's something most business owners don't realize:" },
      { type: 'p', text: "When a traditional bank says no, it doesn't mean your business can't get funded. It means your business doesn't fit their specific credit box." },
      { type: 'p', text: "Banks operate within constraints:" },
      { type: 'p', text: "→ They need a minimum DSCR (usually 1.25x or higher)" },
      { type: 'p', text: "→ They require 2+ years in business (usually)" },
      { type: 'p', text: "→ They want established collateral" },
      { type: 'p', text: "→ They avoid certain industries" },
      { type: 'p', text: "→ They have regulatory constraints on how much they can lend to any one industry" },
      { type: 'p', text: "But alternative lenders operate differently. They look at:" },
      { type: 'p', text: "→ Accounts receivable quality (not just tax returns)" },
      { type: 'p', text: "→ Current business trajectory (not historical DSCR)" },
      { type: 'p', text: "→ Asset value (what you have RIGHT NOW, not what you refinanced)" },
      { type: 'p', text: "→ Revenue and growth rate (instead of industry avoidance)" },
      { type: 'p', text: "So when your bank says no, a good alternative lender often says yes. Not because they're reckless, but because they evaluate differently." },
      { type: 'h2', text: "How to Tell the Difference" },
      { type: 'p', text: "So how do you know if you're talking to a predatory lender or a trustworthy advisor?" },
      { type: 'p', text: "Ask these questions:" },
      { type: 'h3', text: "1. Do they ask questions or just sell?" },
      { type: 'p', text: "A good advisor asks: \"Tell me about your business. What are you trying to accomplish? What assets do you have? What's your timeline?\"" },
      { type: 'p', text: "A predatory lender rushes to the close: \"Here's what we can offer. Sign here.\"" },
      { type: 'h3', text: "2. Are they transparent about costs?" },
      { type: 'p', text: "A good advisor explains the all-in cost (APR) upfront. A predatory lender quotes a \"6% rate\" without explaining it's monthly, and hides fees in fine print." },
      { type: 'h3', text: "3. Do they present options or push one solution?" },
      { type: 'p', text: "A good advisor might say: \"Here's what we can do. But based on your situation, you might also consider this other option. Here's the cost difference.\"" },
      { type: 'p', text: "A predatory lender says: \"This is the only thing available. Take it or leave it.\"" },
      { type: 'h3', text: "4. Are they pressure salespeople or patient advisors?" },
      { type: 'p', text: "A good advisor respects your timeline: \"Take a few days. Think about it. We'll be here.\"" },
      { type: 'p', text: "A predatory lender creates urgency: \"This offer expires today. We need your decision now.\"" },
      { type: 'h2', text: "The Path Forward" },
      { type: 'p', text: "If your bank has already said no, don't despair. Don't panic into a predatory lender either." },
      { type: 'p', text: "Instead:" },
      { type: 'p', text: "1. Ask your banker for recommendations. Most have partners they trust." },
      { type: 'p', text: "2. Ask your CPA or CFO if they know good funding advisors." },
      { type: 'p', text: "3. Look for advisors who ask questions before recommending solutions." },
      { type: 'p', text: "4. Request transparency on all-in costs (APR, not just \"rates\")." },
      { type: 'p', text: "5. Take your time. Legitimate advisors don't pressure you." },
