    id: 'top-what-is-serve-funding',
    q: "What is Serve Funding?",
    a: "Serve Funding is a channel-neutral business financing advisory with access to an extensive network of alternative lenders for working capital from $250K to $100MM. We're not a lender — we're your advocate who compares options across multiple underwriting styles and negotiates on your behalf when traditional banks decline."
  },
  {
    id: 'top-when-banks-say-no',
    q: "What if my bank denied my loan application?",
    a: "Bank declines are our most common starting point — bankers are our primary referral source. We specialize in non-bank financing including asset-based lending, invoice factoring, debt refinance, and MCA consolidation for businesses that don't fit traditional credit boxes. Alternative lenders evaluate whole businesses, not just DSCR or credit scores."
  },
  {
    id: 'top-how-fast-funding',
    q: "How fast can I get funding?",
    a: "Funding speed ranges from 24 hours to 8 weeks depending on the product: emergency payroll in 24-72 hours, working capital loans in 2-10 days, invoice factoring in 3-5 days, and asset-based lending in 4-8 weeks. Serve Funding has closed deals in as little as 3 business days when time was critical."
  },
  {
    id: 'top-debt-refinance',
    q: "Can you help refinance expensive debt?",
    a: "Yes — debt refinancing reduces monthly payments by 30-50% and lowers total cost of capital by 5-10 percentage points annually. We help businesses escape MCA debt traps, consolidate multiple daily/weekly payments into a single monthly payment, and often cash out additional working capital in the process."
  },
  {
    id: 'top-how-much-cost',
    q: "How much does Serve Funding cost?",
    a: "Serve Funding charges a success fee of 1-2% of the funded amount, paid only when you receive financing. No upfront costs, no retainers, no hidden fees. This fee-only-on-success model aligns our incentives entirely with yours — we only get paid when you do."
  },
  {
    id: 'top-industries-served',
    q: "What industries do you serve?",
    a: "Serve Funding works with manufacturing, construction, staffing, healthcare, CPG, e-commerce, government contractors, and professional services. Based in Atlanta and primarily serving the Southeast, we work with clients nationwide for deals from $250K to $100MM."

    q: 'What is Serve Funding?',
    a: 'Serve Funding is a boutique business financing advisory that provides strategic guidance and access to an extensive network of lenders for alternative financing from $250K to $100MM. As a channel-neutral advisor, we\'re not limited by a single lender\'s "credit box"—we tap into multiple underwriting styles. We operate with servant leadership and 15+ years of experience in asset-based and cash-flow lending.'
  },
  {
    id: 'relationships-over-bots',
    q: 'What does "Relationships Over Bots" mean?',
    a: 'We believe tired of automated platforms and generic funding advice? We provide high-touch, relationship-based advisory—not algorithms or quick-fix bots. You work directly with our founder or senior team members who understand your story, fight for your best interests, and negotiate the best terms across our lender network. When you partner with us, a little part of your reputation goes with it—and we protect that trust.'
  },
  {
    id: 'how-does-serve-funding-work',
    q: 'How does Serve Funding work?',
    a: 'We follow a three-step process: Discovery (understanding your needs and goals), Diligence (evaluating financing options across our lender network), and Delivery (guiding you through closing and negotiating on your behalf). Most engagements start with referrals from bankers, CFOs, or CPAs. You\'ll work directly with experienced advisors throughout—no handoffs to junior staff.'
  },
  {
    id: 'what-makes-serve-different',
    q: 'What makes Serve Funding different from other lenders or brokers?',
    a: 'We\'re not a lender—we\'re your trusted advisor with relationships across an extensive lender network and multiple underwriting styles. Unlike captive brokers tied to one lender, we provide unbiased guidance throughout your company\'s growth trajectory. We fight hard to negotiate 10-20 percentage point rate reductions compared to going direct.'
  },
  {
    id: 'can-you-help-if-bank-denied',
    q: 'Can you help if my bank denied me?',
    a: 'Absolutely. When banks say no, we say how. Bankers are our primary referral sources because we specialize in alternative financing that traditional banks don\'t offer. We leverage asset-based lending, invoice factoring, debt refinance, revenue-based financing, and PO funding. We have relationships with dozens of alternative lenders who evaluate businesses differently and often approve when banks decline.'
  },
  {
    id: 'channel-neutral-advisor',
    q: 'What is a channel-neutral advisor?',
    a: 'A channel-neutral advisor is not tied to any single lender or product. Unlike captive brokers who earn commissions from one lender, we maintain relationships across an extensive lender network with different underwriting styles, rate structures, and specialties. This means we can match you with the best lender for your situation—and negotiate aggressively because we\'re not beholden to any single relationship.'
  },
  {
    id: 'why-banks-first',
    q: 'Why do most businesses go to their bank first?',
    a: 'Banks are the cheapest capital source and offer the most favorable terms for businesses that fit their credit boxes. If your banker knows you and can help, that\'s always the right first step. When banks can\'t help—whether due to credit limitations, timing, growth rate, or business model—that\'s when alternative financing becomes the next logical choice. We specialize in solving the problems your bank can\'t.'
  },
  {
    id: 'spot-predatory-lender',
    q: 'How do I know if a lender is predatory?',
    a: 'Red flags include: high-pressure sales tactics ("this offer expires at 5 PM today"), unclear rate disclosures (advertising "6% rates" when APR is actually 80-120%), double-digit fees not explained upfront, claims of "guaranteed approval" without questions, and ads that seem too good to be true. Good lenders ask questions to understand your business, explain everything clearly, and let you shop around without pressure. Trust your gut—if something feels rushed or unclear, it probably is.'
  },
  {
    id: 'tax-return-vs-invoices',
    q: 'Why do some lenders focus on invoices instead of tax returns?',
    a: 'Invoice factoring and asset-based lending evaluate what you\'re earning NOW (invoices and assets), not what you earned last year (tax return). If your business is growing, had a startup year, or faced temporary headwinds, your tax return might not reflect current reality. Your invoices tell the true story: strong customers, reliable payment history, and actual cash flow. We can help even if your tax return shows a loss, as long as your customers are paying reliably.'
  },
  {
    id: 'profitable-need-capital',
    q: 'How much working capital do profitable companies actually need?',
    a: 'Profitability and cash flow are different. A $5M profitable company might need $2.5M+ in working capital to fulfill a $10M growth contract because that money funds materials, payroll, and inventory BEFORE customer payment arrives. A simple rule of thumb: maintain 2-3 months of operating expenses as working capital. For example, $500K monthly expenses suggests $1M-$1.5M in working capital. Growing companies and those with uneven payment terms need even more.'
  },
  {
    id: 'layered-capital-stacking',
    q: 'Can I combine multiple funding sources?',
    a: 'Absolutely. "Layered capital" stacks multiple products to maximize available funds for growth. Example: $1MM AR revolver + $240K unsecured term loan + $550K second mortgage on personal real estate = $1.79MM total capital. This approach gives growing companies more runway without over-leveraging any single source. Each layer serves a different purpose: AR covers working capital needs, term loans provide bridge capital, real estate provides long-term flexibility.'
  },
  {
    id: 'early-payoff-discount',
    q: 'What\'s an "early payoff discount" and how does it work?',
    a: 'When you need quick funding at a higher rate, we build aggressive early payoff discounts into the structure. Scenario: You fund at 18% for 90 days, but close on a customer contract after 2 weeks. Instead of paying 90 days of interest, the early payoff discount lets you exit the loan with only 2 weeks of interest owed. This lets you refinance into a cheaper product immediately. We structure deals expecting this—it rewards clients who get liquidity events quickly.'
  },
  {
    id: 'percentage-need-capital',
    q: 'What percentage of businesses actually need working capital?',
    a: 'Approximately 90%+ of growing companies need working capital at some point in their first 5 years. It might come from family, investors, or lenders, but capital is essential for growth. Some bootstrap it themselves (slower growth), but most need an infusion. Working capital can be a one-time need or ongoing—either way, the vast majority of growing businesses face the need at some point.'
  },
  {
    id: 'maxed-bank-line-options',
    q: 'What if I\'ve maxed out my bank line but still need more capital?',
    a: 'This is where junior/subordinated lending and unsecured options come in. When you\'ve tapped traditional lenders, we have options: unsecured term loans, subordinated debt (mezzanine financing), invoice factoring backed by your AR, or asset-based lines secured by equipment and real estate. These products are designed for businesses that have outgrown their bank but have growth opportunities. They fit \"above\" your bank line in the capital stack.'
  },
  {
    id: 'emergency-payroll-speed',
    q: 'How fast can emergency payroll be funded?',
    a: 'In urgent situations (24-72 hours), we can secure bridge loans, invoice factoring, or lines of credit against upcoming receivables. Real example: $500K payroll emergency funded in 4 business days. Costs vary: bridge solutions typically 1-3% of payroll amount, or Prime + 4-12% annualized for term loans. The key is having assets or invoices to collateralize. Without collateral, speed increases but costs rise accordingly.'
  },
  {
    id: 'why-use-serve-vs-direct',
    q: 'Why should I use Serve Funding instead of going direct to a lender?',
    a: 'Working with a channel-neutral advisor typically reduces your cost of capital by 10-20 percentage points vs. going direct. Here\'s why: we have relationships across an extensive lender network and can negotiate aggressively on your behalf because we\'re not committed to any one relationship. We also guide you away from predatory products and help you avoid costly mistakes. Our 65% repeat client rate shows we deliver value—we succeed only when you do.'

// ============================================================================

export const workingCapitalFAQs: FAQ[] = [
  {
    id: 'what-is-working-capital',
    q: 'What is working capital?',
    a: 'Working capital is the funds available to meet day-to-day operational needs, calculated as current assets minus current liabilities (cash, AR, inventory minus AP and short-term debt). When businesses need "working capital," they\'re seeking additional liquidity to grow without running out of money, meet obligations, and scale operations. Positive working capital means you have enough liquid assets to cover short-term obligations.'
  },
  {
    id: 'how-to-refinance-business-debt',
    q: 'How do I refinance high-cost business debt?',
    a: 'Debt refinancing replaces expensive debt (MCAs, high-interest loans, multiple payments) with a single, more affordable solution. We help you consolidate debt, reduce monthly payments by 30-50%, and often cash out additional working capital. Most refinances close in 10-20 business days using asset-based lending or term loans. The key is having sufficient revenue ($1MM+ annually) and ideally some collateral (AR, inventory, equipment, or real estate).'
  },
  {
    id: 'how-to-escape-mca-debt',
    q: 'How do I escape merchant cash advance (MCA) debt?',
    a: 'MCA consolidation refinances daily or weekly MCA payments into a single monthly term loan or line of credit with significantly lower costs. We\'ve helped dozens of businesses escape MCA debt traps by securing asset-based lending, term loans, or revenue-based financing that costs 10-20 percentage points less annually. The key is acting before cash flow becomes too constrained—contact us as soon as you realize MCA payments are unsustainable.'
  },
  {
    id: 'emergency-payroll-financing',
    q: 'How fast can I get emergency payroll financing?',
    a: 'Emergency payroll financing can fund in 24-72 hours in many cases. Our fastest payroll solution closed in 4 business days, ensuring every employee was paid on time with zero disruption. We structure payroll financing through short-term bridge loans, invoice factoring, or lines of credit against upcoming receivables. Costs range from 1-3% of payroll amount for bridge solutions or Prime + 4-12% annualized for term loans.'
  },
  {
    id: 'how-much-working-capital-needed',
    q: 'How much working capital do I need?',
    a: 'The amount varies by business size, growth rate, industry, and operating costs—heavier overhead industries need more, while asset-light businesses need less. A common rule of thumb is maintaining 2-3 months of operating expenses. For example, $500K in monthly expenses suggests $1M-$1.5M in working capital. Rapidly growing companies and those with uneven payment terms need more to bridge cash flow gaps.'
  },
  {
    id: 'what-is-working-capital-loan',
    q: 'What is a working capital loan?',
    a: 'A working capital loan is short-term financing ($100K to $5MM+) that provides cash for payroll, inventory, and expenses, typically approved in 1-3 business days. These loans are based on revenue and growth potential rather than credit scores alone, with terms of 6-24 months. Modern working capital loans are often called merchant cash advances (MCAs) and can be used for inventory, marketing, hiring, or bridging payment term gaps.'
  },
  {
    id: 'how-much-cost-wc-loan',
    q: 'What is the cost of working capital loans?',
    a: 'Costs typically range from 1.5-4% per month (18-48% annualized) depending on creditworthiness, revenue, and who negotiates on your behalf. Strong credit (700+), established businesses (3+ years), and growing revenues get lower rates (18-25% APR), while newer businesses or cash flow challenges face higher rates. Serve Funding fights hard to negotiate 10-20 percentage point reductions compared to going direct to lenders.'
  },
  {
    id: 'can-use-wc-for-growth',
    q: 'Can I use working capital loans for growth investments?',
    a: 'Absolutely. Working capital loans are ideally suited for growth—it takes money to make money. Businesses use them to fund inventory buildup, hire ahead of revenue, invest in marketing and sales, enter new markets, and purchase equipment. A $500K loan invested in inventory, marketing, and staff can generate $2MM in new revenue with strong ROI when the business model is proven and market demand is validated.'
  },
  {
    id: 'what-if-cash-flow-irregular',
    q: 'What if my cash flow is irregular or seasonal?',
    a: 'Seasonal and irregular cash flow don\'t disqualify you—they\'re actually perfect reasons to seek working capital. Businesses need financing to maintain payroll and inventory during slow periods while preparing for busy ones. Revolving lines of credit, working capital loans, and invoice factoring all work well for seasonal businesses. Landscaping, retail, hospitality, and tourism companies commonly use working capital to bridge seasonal gaps.',

  {
    id: 'can-get-wc-for-payroll',
    q: 'Can I get working capital for payroll emergencies?',
    a: 'Absolutely. Payroll emergencies from delayed customer payments, depleted cash reserves, or unexpected expenses are common drivers for working capital. When payroll is due but cash flow hasn\'t caught up, time isn\'t just money—it\'s team trust and operational stability. We can fund payroll emergencies in 1-2 business days through short-term bridge loans or invoice factoring without exploiting your urgency.',

  },
  {
    id: 'what-credit-score-needed',
    q: 'What credit score do I need for business financing?',
    a: 'Credit score requirements vary by solution. Asset-based lending and invoice factoring focus on collateral value (550+ credit often acceptable). Term loans and lines of credit typically require 600-650+ for approval. Debt refinancing and MCA consolidation can work with 550+ if you have strong revenue and assets. The key advantage of alternative financing is that credit score is just one factor—revenue, assets, and business trajectory matter more.',

  // RBF/MCA Critical Questions
  {
    id: 'mca-vs-rbf-which-to-use',
    q: 'Should I use MCA or RBF—and what\'s the difference?',
    a: 'The core difference: MCAs take daily or weekly cuts from your card sales (typically 10-20%), while RBF takes a fixed monthly percentage (typically 5-15%) that scales with revenue. MCA hits hardest on slow days and weekends when you need cash most; RBF is predictable regardless of daily fluctuations. Working capital loans (RBF) at 1.25%-4% per month typically cost 30-50% less than MCA, making them the better choice for sustainable growth.',
    relatedSolutions: ['working-capital-loans', 'invoice-factoring', 'debt-refinance']
  },

  {
    id: 'mca-factor-rate-real-cost',
    q: 'What is an MCA factor rate, and how much will it actually cost me?',
    a: 'Factor rates hide true costs—a "1.3 factor rate" means you owe $130K on a $100K advance, which looks like 30% but is actually much higher depending on repayment speed. Over 5-6 months, that 1.3x factor rate translates to roughly 50-80%+ APR; over 3 months, it\'s significantly higher. By comparison, invoice factoring at Prime + 1-6% or working capital loans at 1.25%-4% monthly give you transparent pricing you can actually compare.',
    relatedSolutions: ['debt-refinance', 'invoice-factoring', 'working-capital-loans']
  },

  {
    id: 'mca-daily-payments-cash-flow',
    q: 'Why do MCA daily payments destroy cash flow?',
    a: 'Because MCA pulls from revenue you haven\'t stabilized yet—if 15% of daily card sales goes to MCA, slow days still require full pulls even when you\'re short on cash. Real scenario: staffing agencies need cash on Monday before weekend payroll, but if Monday is light, they\'re still short. This creates a debt spiral where you take a second or third MCA just to cover payroll, and suddenly you\'re extracting 60%+ of revenue just to service debt. We\'ve helped dozens escape this trap through debt refinancing into single monthly payments that free up 30-50% of what they were paying.',

  {
    id: 'how-to-escape-mca-process',
    q: 'How do I actually escape MCA debt?',
    a: 'Stop taking new advances immediately, then refinance your balance into a term loan, asset-based line, or invoice factoring—typically closing in 10-20 business days. We shop your situation across an extensive lender network because your invoices, AR, and revenue are real collateral; most clients qualify for solutions that cost 10-20 percentage points less annually than their current MCA. Real example: a staffing company paying $15K/month in MCA fees refinanced into an $8K/month term loan, freeing up $7K monthly for growth.',

    q: 'How do I spot a predatory MCA lender?',
    a: 'Red flags include high-pressure sales ("offer expires at 5 PM"), refusing to explain factor rate math or APR, non-negotiable daily pulls, prepayment penalties, and confession of judgment clauses. Good lenders ask about your business, disclose APR upfront, and let you shop around without pressure. When in doubt, have us review the terms before you sign—we spot predatory language regularly.',

  {
    id: 'rbf-vs-traditional-loan-when-use',
    q: 'When should I use RBF instead of a bank loan?',
    a: 'Use RBF when you\'re growing faster than banks can approve, your tax return doesn\'t match current revenue, or you\'ve maxed your bank line but are still scaling. Banks typically approve in 4-8 weeks; RBF closes in 1-2 weeks and adapts to revenue growth. RBF costs more (1.25%-4% monthly) than bank loans (typically 6-12% APR), so our advice is always bank first if your banker can help—but RBF when they can\'t keep up with your growth.',

Real example: $150K MCA balance with daily extractions owed roughly $195K total; refinanced to a term loan that costs $7K/month instead of $32K/month.

  // Invoice Factoring
  {
    id: "what-is-invoice-factoring",
    q: "What is invoice factoring?",
    a: "Invoice factoring is when you sell your unpaid B2B invoices to a factor for immediate cash. You get 75-95% of invoice value within 24-48 hours instead of waiting 30-90 days. Unlike a term loan, factoring is self-liquidating—as customers pay, the debt automatically decreases.",

    id: "how-quickly-cash-factoring",
    q: "How quickly can I get cash?",
    a: "Approval typically takes 2-3 weeks. Once approved, you receive 75-95% of invoice value within 24-48 hours. Our real example: healthcare supply manufacturer approved and funded in 3 weeks, then expanded from $1MM to $1.5MM within 2 months as sales grew.",
    relatedSolutions: ["invoice-factoring"]
  },
  {
    id: "tax-return-factoring",
    q: "Can I get factoring if my tax return shows a loss?",
    a: "Yes! This is one of factoring's biggest advantages over traditional bank loans. Banks look at tax returns. We look at invoices. If your customers are paying reliably and your invoices are strong, your tax return doesn't disqualify you. Your invoice quality and customer creditworthiness are what matter.",

  },
  {
    id: "factoring-vs-bank-loan",
    q: "Why is factoring better than a bank line of credit?",
    a: "Factoring is self-liquidating (debt decreases as customers pay), scales automatically with your sales, has no balance sheet impact, and doesn't require collateral beyond your invoices. Banks require strong credit, tax returns, and collateral—and their rates are often higher. A real example: one client got Prime + 2% on AR factoring (single-digit when combined), vs. traditional bank rates of 8-13%.",

    q: 'How does government contract financing work?',
    a: 'A lender advances against the value of a federal, state, or local contract or receivable — usually up to 90% — so you can fund production and payroll before the government pays. The structure normally combines a PO line (covers materials and labor before invoice) with an AR line (covers the wait from invoice to payment). As of 2026, the full cycle is typically 60 days PO plus 60 days AR — about 120 days of capital commitment per order.',

    q: 'Can subcontractors on a prime contract get financing?',
    a: "Yes — and this is one of the most under-served corners of the market. Most traditional factors won't touch a sub-on-a-prime because the account debtor is another contractor rather than the government directly. Serve Funding works with lenders who specifically finance GovCon subcontractors against the prime's commitment, which opens up a category that's a hard no almost everywhere else.",

  {
    id: 'why-government-payment-takes-so-long',
    q: 'Why does the government take so long to pay?',
    a: "The clock doesn't start when you deliver — it starts when the contracting officer formally accepts the work, often after inspection and document sign-off. Sixty days from acceptance is normal across DoD, GSA, and most state and local agencies, and net-30 contracts frequently pay in 45. That timing isn't a sign of a problem; it's just the rhythm of government work, which is exactly why a PO+AR facility exists.",

  },
  {
    id: 'assignment-of-claims-explained',
    q: 'What is assignment of claims and why does it slow GovCon financing?',
    a: "Assignment of claims is the legal process that lets a government payment be redirected from the contractor to a lender — it's the equivalent of a lockbox for commercial AR, but with federal paperwork attached. The contracting officer has to sign off, which typically adds three to four weeks of setup time. It's why government AR facilities are best set up before you desperately need them, with a small unused-line fee to keep the facility available for sporadic billing.",

    q: 'Should I use a GovCon-specialist lender or a generalist?',
    a: "It depends on the mix. If 100% of what you do is government work, a specialist lender is almost always the right call — they understand assignment of claims, CO procedures, and milestone billing in a way generalists don't. If GovCon is a slice of a mostly commercial book — say, 10% to 30% — a generalist AR or ABL lender usually handles the whole portfolio, with the government receivables included.",

If you check those boxes, SBA is almost always the cheapest capital available. If you don't — say you had a rough trailing 12 months, or you need money in the next 30 days — there are better-fit products to look at first.",

As of 2026, SBA underwriting is 4 to 12 weeks; asset-based lending is 4 to 8 weeks; factoring is 2 to 4 weeks; a revenue-based bridge can fund in days. If your business is clean and profitable and you can wait, do SBA. If you need money sooner or your numbers aren't SBA-ready, alternative financing is the better answer.",

    a: 'The 7(a) is the workhorse — general business purposes including acquisitions, working capital, refinance, and equipment, up to the $5MM SBA cap. The 504 is structured around fixed-asset purchases (real estate, major equipment), with a bank loan paired with a CDC second and longer amortization on the property piece. Most operators looking at "an SBA loan" are looking at a 7(a); 504 is the right structure if the deal is anchored by a real-estate purchase.',

    a: "SBA is its own discipline — the underwriting, the disclosure rules, the program-by-program nuances, the SBA Form 159 process. The SBA also won't allow a broker to charge a success fee on the borrower side and collect lender compensation on the same deal, which makes generalist brokers a bad fit. Serve refers every SBA out to a former SBA banker who runs an SBA-only practice and stays close to make sure the client is served well.",

    a: 'Yes — and this is one of the more common SBA pairings we set up. Because SBA takes 4 to 12 weeks, a parallel bridge — usually a revenue-based line, factoring facility, or short-term asset-backed loan — can fund within days to weeks and tide you over until the SBA closes. The bridge gets paid off when the SBA funds, and you only pay interest for the days you actually used the money.',

    a: "Yes — and for the right profile, it's usually the cheapest capital in your stack. If your commercial property is free and clear or has real equity behind a first mortgage, a cash-out refinance or second-position loan pulls that \"dead equity\" out at rates that almost always beat an asset-based line or inventory loan. Real estate is the lender's favorite asset, so the rates reflect that. The right structure depends on whether you're optimizing for lowest rate, lowest debt service, or maximum cash out.",

    a: 'It depends on the asset. Owner-occupied commercial property typically supports 65%+ LTV, and you can often layer a line of credit on top that pushes effective leverage closer to 80% when the operating business is underwritten alongside. Investment / non-owner-occupied is DSCR-driven and varies with rental income. Raw land is a different animal — 50% LTV is the practical ceiling, and these deals close slower because fewer lenders touch them.',

  {
    id: 're-bridge-vs-permanent',
    q: 'Should I take a bridge loan or a permanent mortgage on my property?',
    a: "Depends on what you're optimizing for. A fully amortizing 25-year mortgage gives you the lowest rate but higher debt service because you're paying principal every month. A bridge is interest-only — the rate is a few points higher, but the monthly debt service is considerably lower, which matters a lot if cash is tight. If you can refinance into a permanent structure in 12-24 months at a better rate, the bridge often pencils out better in the meantime.",

    q: 'What is a sell-leaseback and when does it make sense?',
    a: "Sell-leaseback is when you sell your owner-occupied property to an investor and immediately lease it back, so operations continue uninterrupted. It extracts the maximum cash — close to 100% of the value, versus 65-75% on a mortgage — but you give up the asset and take on a long-term lease obligation. It usually makes sense when an owner wants to pull the most capital possible to redeploy into the business and doesn't mind no longer owning the real estate.",

    id: 're-bad-years-can-i-still-qualify',
    q: 'My business had a few rough years. Can I still borrow against my real estate?',
    a: "Often yes. We work with real-estate-backed SBA lenders and private-credit groups that don't get scared off by a couple of negative years on the P&L if the property and the forward story support it. They'll do pro-forma underwrites — looking at where the business is going, not just trailing twelve months. The property carries most of the underwriting weight, which is why real-estate-backed structures are often the path for owners who don't fit a clean bank credit box.",

    q: 'What is "stretch capital" and when do I need it?',
    a: "Stretch capital is the layer that sits on top of your senior secured debt — usually a subordinated or unsecured loan — when you've already pledged your obvious collateral but still need more dollars to get the deal done. It's how layered-capital stacks actually get built: senior secured first (cheapest), then stretch on top to reach the full number. You need it when the senior lender can't size the facility large enough on its own and the incremental dollars unlock real upside.",

  },
  {
    id: 'subordinated-vs-unsecured',
    q: "What's the difference between subordinated debt and unsecured debt?",
    a: "Subordinated debt is still secured — there's a lien — but it sits behind your senior lender in priority, so if anything goes sideways, the senior gets paid first. It typically lends at 1-5× EBITDA. Unsecured debt skips the lien entirely: no UCC filing, sometimes no personal guarantee, priced higher because the lender has no collateral. Subordinated is more common in M&A and larger growth deals; unsecured shows up more on smaller bridge and gap-fill situations.",

  },
  {
    id: 'will-stretch-capital-mess-up-senior-line',
    q: 'Will subordinated or unsecured debt interfere with my existing bank or ABL line?',
    a: "Not if it's structured correctly — that's the whole point. Subordinated lenders sign intercreditor agreements with your senior lender so the lien priority is documented and the bank stays comfortable. Some unsecured products carry no UCC filing at all, which makes them especially clean from the senior's perspective. The bank usually appreciates a well-structured stretch layer, because it lets them keep their senior position right-sized without having to overextend.",

  {
    id: 'subordinated-debt-cost',
    q: 'How much does subordinated or unsecured stretch capital cost?',
    a: 'As of 2026, pricing typically runs Prime + 4-8% depending on cash-flow strength, lien position, and how subordinated the layer is. That\'s more expensive than the senior secured piece underneath — by design, because the lender is taking more risk. The honest question to ask isn\'t "is this cheap?" but "do the incremental dollars unlock enough upside to justify the cost?" When the answer is yes, this is the tool that gets the deal done.',
    relatedSolutions: ['unsecured-debt']
  },
  {
    id: 'unsecured-no-pg',
    q: 'Are there unsecured products with no personal guarantee?',
    a: "A few, yes — they exist but they're rare and the underwriting bar is higher. Most stretch-capital products will ask for a PG, especially if the structure is unsecured and there's no collateral to anchor it. When a no-PG option is on the table, it tends to be priced at the higher end of the range and the lender is leaning heavily on the historical cash flow and the strength of the senior secured structure underneath. We surface these options when they fit; we don't promise them blind.",

A good bridge has a visible, time-bound take-out — an ABL closing in 60 days, a property under contract, a senior facility under written term sheet, a contract with assignment of claims signed. A bad bridge has no defined exit and ends up rolling into another bridge, then another.

    a: "Not if you only carry it for the days you actually need it. Bridge products are built to exit fast, usually 30-180 days, and most carry aggressive early-payoff discounts so the effective cost scales with how long you hold the capital. A 6-7% annualized rate held for 60 days on a strong-margin deal is almost always worth it. The mistake is treating bridge like a long-term loan — that's when the annualized number actually hurts you.",

We call it a "one-then-three" approach: get a fast revenue-based or unsecured bridge in place in days, then run the asset-based facility in parallel knowing it takes 6-8 weeks to close. The bridge stabilizes operations during the gap; the ABL is the permanent structure. When the ABL funds, it takes out the bridge.',

The variables that determine speed are how complete the financials are, whether the exit event is documented, and how clean the existing senior debt picture is. Truly fast (1-2 day) closes exist for established cash-flowing businesses with strong bank-statement history; complex collateral or thin documentation pushes closer to the two-week mark.',

    a: 'No, and the distinction matters. A merchant cash advance is short-term capital with daily or weekly debits, typically no defined exit event, and pricing that gets dramatically worse if you stack multiple advances.
