    introduction:
      'Invoice factoring and asset-based lending are close cousins. Both create a revolving line collateralized by your receivables, both set up a lockbox or controlled bank account where customer payments land, and both scale availability up and down as you invoice and collect. The difference comes down to balance-sheet treatment and how much of your business is being used as collateral. Factoring is a recurring sale of an asset — your invoices — so it does not show up on your balance sheet as debt and the lender mostly underwrites your customers, not you. ABL is a true debt line that sits on the balance sheet, blends underwriting between your AR and your other hard assets, and typically gives you more borrowing power per dollar of receivable because inventory and equipment can be folded in.\n\nThe short answer most prospects need: if your receivables are strong but your tax return is not, factoring is usually the right tool, because the factor is leaning on your customers\' credit rather than yours. If you have a meaningful inventory or equipment base alongside the AR, you can usually borrow more total dollars under ABL and read more like a bank line on your statements — at the cost of a longer underwrite and a more involved monthly borrowing-base certificate.\n\nNeither product is a sign of distress. Both are the standard answer when a growing company has outrun the bank box and needs more working capital than a traditional line can deliver.',

      narrative:
        'Pick factoring when the strongest thing on your balance sheet is your receivable — and especially when your tax return understates your real business. Factors are not really lending against you; they are buying your receivable at a small discount, and the credit risk they care about is your customer\'s ability to pay. That is the wedge. A staffing agency with three years of growth but a loss-year tax return cannot get a $2M bank line — but if the agency is invoicing creditworthy commercial customers on net-30 to net-60 terms, a factor will buy those invoices all day. The setup runs 2–3 weeks, advances on individual invoices clear in 24–48 hours, and the line scales automatically as you invoice more.\n\nFactoring also wins when AR is the only collateral story you have. There is no minimum inventory requirement, no equipment audit, no real-estate appraisal. The underwriting is the receivable itself — the verification call, the aging, and the customer\'s payment history. You do give up some flexibility: the factor sets up a separate lockbox so customer payments come straight to them, and you have to be comfortable with your customers knowing the bank account changed. In our experience most B2B customers do not notice or care. The notification letter goes to AP, they update the remittance, and life goes on.',
      bullets: [
        'Your tax return shows a loss but sales are growing and customers pay on time',
        'You are a staffing, commercial construction, manufacturing, or government-contracting business with net-30 to net-90 terms',
        'You do not have meaningful inventory or equipment to fold into the collateral pool',

        'You are comfortable with customers remitting to a new lockbox account',
      ],
    },
    whenToPickB: {
      narrative:
        'Pick ABL when you have receivables and at least one other meaningful asset category — inventory at cost, equipment, sometimes commercial real estate — and the combined collateral pool lets you borrow more than a pure factoring line would deliver. ABL is also the right answer when balance-sheet optics matter: it reads as a debt facility, which is what investors, surety bond providers, and senior lenders expect to see on a growing company\'s statements. It is the standard replacement for a maxed-out bank line.\n\nThe trade-off is the underwrite. ABL closes in 4–8 weeks, not days, because the lender is sizing every collateral bucket — AR aging, inventory turn, equipment liquidation value — and building a borrowing base around them. After close, you supply a weekly or monthly borrowing-base certificate so the lender can track availability. That is more reporting than factoring requires, but you pay less per dollar borrowed (Prime + 1–5% vs. factoring\'s blended cost) and you get to count inventory and equipment toward your line, not just receivables. Most bank ABL desks start at $3–5M minimums, which is why deals below that threshold usually need an advisor with multiple non-bank ABL relationships.',
      bullets: [
        'You have $250K+ in AR plus inventory and/or equipment to pledge',
        'Your financials are clean enough to support a real debt facility',
        'You want a single revolver rather than stitching factoring + inventory + equipment',
        'You can wait 4–8 weeks to close in exchange for lower all-in cost',
        'Balance-sheet treatment as a credit line (not a sale) matters for your stakeholders',
      ],
    },
    workedExample: {
      scenario:
        'A $4MM commercial manufacturer with $800K in eligible AR (net-45 terms, blue-chip OEM customers), $600K in finished-goods inventory at cost, and $400K in free-and-clear production equipment needs a revolving facility to fund a 40% growth year.',
      math:
        'Factoring path: 85% advance on the $800K AR = $680K of working availability. Cost: roughly 1.5% per month all-in on drawn balance, with the line growing automatically as sales grow. Setup in 2–3 weeks.\n\nABL path: 85% on the $800K AR ($680K) plus 50% on the $600K inventory ($300K) plus 60% on the $400K of equipment ($240K) = $1.22MM of total availability. Cost: Prime + 2.5% on drawn balance. Close in 6–8 weeks plus a weekly borrowing-base certificate going forward.',
      takeaway:
        'Factoring is faster and works on the AR alone. ABL gives this borrower roughly 80% more total availability — $1.22MM vs. $680K — by folding inventory and equipment into the same revolver. For a company growing 40% with real inventory turn, that extra room is worth the extra four weeks of underwriting.',

It is a recurring sale of an asset to the factory… ABL is very similar to that in most respects.

        question: 'Will my customers know I am using factoring or ABL?',
        answer:
          'Yes, in most structures. Both products set up a lockbox (or a DACA / controlled bank account in the ABL case), and customers receive a notification letter telling them to remit payments to the new account. In practice your AP contact updates the remittance and life goes on — the lender will also place a verification call or two at the start of the relationship to confirm the invoice is real.

        question: 'Why does factoring not show up as debt?',
        answer:
          'Because it is structured as a recurring sale of an asset, not a loan. The factor buys your invoice at a discount; you assign the receivable to them; they collect from your customer; and the difference between face value and what they paid you is their margin. There is no principal balance accruing interest on your balance sheet. ABL is the opposite — it is a true revolving line of credit, so the drawn balance is reported as debt and the lender wants a weekly or monthly borrowing-base certificate to track availability.',

      {
        question: 'Can I borrow against inventory under a factoring line?',
        answer:
          'Sometimes, but it is usually small and secondary. Most factors will fold in an inventory advance as an add-on to the AR line, often capped at 50% of eligible AR rather than priced as a separate inventory facility. If inventory is a meaningful piece of your collateral story, ABL is structurally the better tool — the lender will size a real inventory bucket (typically 50–75% advance on liquidation value of finished goods) inside the same revolver as the AR.',

        question: 'How fast can I get money under each one?',
        answer:
          'Factoring setup runs 2–3 weeks, and once the line is live each invoice you upload typically funds in 24–48 hours. ABL takes 4–8 weeks to close because the lender is underwriting multiple asset categories at once and building a borrowing base around them. If speed is the binding constraint, factoring almost always wins; if availability and cost matter more than the next four weeks, ABL is usually the better tool.',

      {
        question: 'What does each one actually cost in 2026?',
        answer:
          'Factoring is typically priced at Prime + 1–6% on the drawn balance, plus a factor fee of roughly 0.25%–1% per invoice. Blended all-in cost on a well-run facility runs 1–1.5% per month. ABL is priced at Prime + 1–5% as straight interest on the drawn balance with no per-invoice fee, so for the same average drawn balance ABL tends to cost a half-point to a full point less per year. The wedge widens as the facility scales.',

        answer:
          'Yes, and we see this regularly. A growing company will start on factoring while the tax returns catch up to current revenue, then refinance into ABL once the financials support a true debt facility. The lockbox infrastructure largely transfers, customers are already trained to remit to a lockbox, and the AR aging and customer-payment data the factor has built up makes the ABL underwrite materially easier.',

Bank ABL desks rarely look at deals below $3M, though, and they are stricter on financial covenants than non-bank ABL lenders. For deals in the $250K–$3M range, or for borrowers whose financials are growing into the credit box rather than already sitting in it, non-bank ABL lenders and factors are typically where the deal actually closes.',

    introduction:
      'An SBA 7(a) loan and a working capital loan solve the same general problem — a business that needs cash to grow or stabilize — but they sit at opposite ends of the speed/cost trade-off. The SBA loan is the cheapest dollar a small business will typically ever borrow: government-guaranteed, capped at Prime + 2–3%, amortized over up to 10 years for working capital and 25 years for real estate. The cost of that price is time. Expect 4–12 weeks to close, two years of clean financial statements, complete personal financial disclosures, and in most cases a lien on your home or other personal assets.\n\nA working capital loan inverts every one of those trade-offs. The underwriting is done off your last 3–6 months of bank statements, the term is short (6–24 months), payments are monthly, the rate is 1.25%–4% per month rather than per year, and the money is in your account in 2–10 business days. There is no SBA paperwork, no two-year financial review, no home lien.\n\nThe short answer: if you can wait, take the SBA every time — the rate alone justifies the patience. If you cannot wait, or the bank has already passed because your financials do not fit their credit box, a working capital loan is the structurally honest fast option. It is not cheap. It is also not predatory the way a daily-pull MCA can be — the monthly payment structure keeps cash flow predictable, which is the difference that matters.',

        'Pick an SBA loan when the math of the rate matters more than the speed of the close. The SBA 7(a) is the cheapest capital most small businesses will ever access — Prime + 2–3%, amortized over up to a decade — and on a multi-year hold the difference between SBA pricing and revenue-based pricing is enormous. A $1MM SBA loan at Prime + 2.5% over 10 years costs a fraction of the same $1MM borrowed at 2% per month for 18 months and then refinanced. If the use of funds is acquisition, real estate, or a capital expenditure with a long payback, SBA is almost always the right answer.\n\nThe price of that rate is patience and paperwork. Expect 4–12 weeks to close, sometimes longer if the deal involves real estate. You will need two years of business tax returns, two years of personal tax returns, year-to-date financials, a personal financial statement from every 20%+ owner, and in most cases a lien on your home or other personal real estate. SBA Express (loans of $500K and below) moves faster, and there are non-bank SBA lenders that will sometimes find structures without a home lien — but the underwriting depth is the same. If the business is not yet two years old, has loss years on the tax return, or the owner cannot pledge personal real estate, the SBA path usually does not work.',

        'Pick a working capital loan when speed is the binding constraint, or when your financials do not yet fit a bank or SBA credit box. The underwriting is done off your bank statements, not your tax return, which is exactly why it funds in days when a bank would take weeks. That same speed is also the trade-off: the rate is 1.25%–4% per month, not per year, and the term is short (6–24 months typical) with fixed monthly payments.\n\nThe most important thing to understand about this product is that it is structurally safer than a merchant cash advance even though it sits in roughly the same speed-and-cost neighborhood. MCAs pull payments daily out of your operating account; working capital loans bill monthly. That single difference — monthly vs. daily — is the difference between a product you can manage and a product that erodes cash flow every business day. At the same speed as an MCA, a well-structured working capital loan typically costs roughly half as much because the payment is monthly rather than a daily extraction from sales. Use this product the way you would use any short-term loan: with a clear use of funds, a clear payback plan, and a refinance strategy if the use of funds turns into a longer-term need.',

        'SBA 7(a) path: $750K at Prime + 2.5% (assume 10.5% all-in in 2026) amortized over 10 years ≈ $10,100 per month in P&I, total interest over the life of the loan ~$462K. Close in 8–10 weeks. Lien on the home likely required.\n\nWorking capital loan path: $750K at 1.75% per month (interest on declining balance, 18-month amortization) ≈ $48,800 per month in P&I, total interest cost ~$128K, no real-estate lien.\n\nA note on rate format: working capital loans are quoted as a monthly rate rather than APR because the term is short and the comparison is only honest on the actual monthly payment schedule. 1.75% per month on declining balance annualizes to roughly 23% APR effective. Confirm with your term sheet whether the rate is interest on declining balance or a flat fee on the original principal — the same headline number means very different total cost under each.',
      takeaway:
        'For a contract with a 60–90 day payback, the working capital loan funds in time to actually capture the contract — that is the whole point. For a recapitalization or longer-term growth use, the SBA loan costs four times less per dollar borrowed over the life of the deal.

Monthly pricing is also how the product is structurally honest about what it is — a short-term loan you should pay off in 6–24 months, not a 10-year facility.

    introduction:
      'A working capital loan and a line of credit are both general-purpose answers to a working-capital gap, but they have very different shapes. A working capital loan is a single lump sum that lands in your account on day one and amortizes back over a fixed term, typically 6–24 months, on a fixed monthly payment. You take it, you use it, you pay it back. A line of credit is a pool of approved capital that sits there available; you draw against it as needs come up, you only pay interest on what is currently outstanding, and as you pay it down the availability refills — what Mike calls "water in a cup."\n\nThe short decision: if you have one clear use of funds with a clear payback (a contract about to close, a six-month inventory build, a known seasonal spike), a working capital loan is simpler and cheaper than carrying an unused line. If your cash needs are episodic — payroll some weeks, vendor payments other weeks, an unpredictable rhythm of working-capital gaps — a line of credit costs less in aggregate because you are not paying interest on dollars you are not currently using.\n\nLines of credit also come in two flavors that matter for this comparison. A traditional bank or non-bank revolver sits there indefinitely and gets renewed annually. A revenue-based revolving line is the fast-funding cousin — typically a non-bank product, available in 2–4 weeks, priced higher than a bank line but lower than a working capital loan if you actually use it lightly.',

      narrative:
        'Pick a working capital loan when you can name the use of funds in one sentence and the payback timeline in another. A contract just closed and you need $400K to fund delivery. A specific inventory build needs $250K over four months and recovers as sales come in. Payroll needs to be covered for two months while a slow-paying customer catches up. In all of these cases, the math is clean: take a lump sum, deploy it, pay it back on a monthly schedule that fits the recovery curve of the use of funds. The simplicity is the product.\n\nThe other reason to pick a working capital loan is speed. A line of credit — even a fast revenue-based revolver — typically takes 2–4 weeks to set up. A working capital loan can be funded in 2–10 business days. If the use of funds has a deadline (a vendor needs to be paid Friday, a contract needs material ordered next week), the lump-sum product is the only realistic option. The trade-off is that you pay interest on the full balance from day one — there is no concept of "I only need half of it for the first month." You took the whole thing; you pay on the whole thing.',

      narrative:
        'Pick a line of credit when your cash-flow shape is episodic rather than event-driven. Payroll Fridays where deposits run a little behind. Vendor payment days where you front the cash before customer payments land. A seasonal business that ramps inventory in Q3 and unwinds it in Q4. In these cases, you are not solving a single problem — you are smoothing a recurring rhythm — and the right tool is a pool of capital you can draw against as needs come up, only paying interest on what is currently out.\n\nThe key discipline of a line of credit is that you have to actually pay it down when you have cash. The water-in-a-cup mechanic only works if you keep refilling the cup. Borrowers who treat a line as a permanent draw end up paying full-balance interest indefinitely and lose the entire structural advantage. The product rewards borrowers who use it the way it was designed: in and out. For businesses with strong AR, an AR-backed revolver (factoring or ABL) is typically the cheapest version of this product. For businesses without strong AR — services firms, SaaS, recurring-revenue businesses — a revenue-based revolving line is the non-bank alternative, sized at roughly 10–15% of annual revenue, priced higher than a bank line but available in 2–4 weeks.',

      scenario:
        'A $2.8MM HVAC contractor has seasonal payroll spikes — three months a year where weekly payroll runs roughly $80K higher than non-peak season. Total seasonal need is about $240K above the trough, but the contractor only needs all of it for about six weeks.',
      math:
        'Working capital loan path: $300K lump sum at 1.75% per month (interest on declining balance, 12-month amortization) ≈ $28,000 per month in P&I, total interest cost ~$42K. Even though peak need is six weeks, the loan terms force the cash out of the business in fixed monthly payments for the full year.\n\nLine of credit path: $300K revolver at Prime + 5% (assume 13% APR in 2026). Interest accrues only on the outstanding balance: about $3,250 per month while fully drawn, zero when paid down. If average utilization is roughly $90K over the year (six weeks fully drawn, the rest at zero), annual interest cost is around $11,700.\n\nThe comparison holds because the LOC lets the contractor pay down between peaks. If utilization were continuous, the LOC at ~13% APR would still beat the loan at ~23% APR effective — just by a narrower margin.',
      takeaway:
        'For an episodic cash-flow shape, the line of credit ends up costing roughly a quarter of the lump-sum loan — not because the rate is dramatically better, but because the line stops charging interest the moment the cash isn\'t needed. Flip the scenario to a single $300K equipment purchase with a 12-month payback and the lump-sum loan is the better structural fit: at continuous utilization, the rate advantage of the line narrows, and the predictability of fixed monthly payments matters more.',

      'A bridge loan and a term loan look similar on the surface — both lump sums, both with a monthly payment, both unsecured-to-lightly-secured. The structural difference is the exit. A bridge loan is built to be paid off in 30–180 days when a specific event closes: a property sale, an acquisition, a contract payment, a permanent loan funding behind it. It is interest-only for most of its life, has aggressive early-payoff discounts so you only pay interest for the days you actually use the money, and the underwriter is mostly asking "what is the exit and how confident am I in it?"\n\nA term loan is built to live on your balance sheet for years. Three to seven year amortization, full principal-and-interest payments, the lender is underwriting your ability to service the debt out of operating cash flow over the entire term. The use of funds is something with a long payback — equipment, acquisition, recapitalization, multi-year growth investment — and the right way to think about the rate is the lifetime cost over the full amortization, not the monthly payment.\n\nThe short answer: if you can name the exit event and its expected close date, a bridge loan is the right tool because you only pay for the months you actually use. If the use of funds has a payback measured in years rather than months, a term loan is structurally cheaper because you spread the cost across the timeline of the recovery.',

Six or seven percent annualized sounds horrible until you realize the loan is outstanding for two months — at which point the actual dollar cost is a small fraction of the deal it is enabling.\n\nThe classic uses are acquisition timing gaps (you have a closing date but a working-capital piece is not in place yet), permanent-loan bridges (the long-term financing is approved but cannot fund for six weeks), contract pre-funding (the contract has a payment milestone but you need to fund delivery first), and seasonal timing gaps.

In all of these cases, the right way to spread the cost is over the timeline of the recovery, which is what a term loan does: full P&I amortization over three to seven years, fixed monthly payment, predictable budgeting.\n\nThe right comparison for term-loan pricing is the lifetime cost over the full amortization, not the monthly payment. A $1MM term loan at Prime + 4% over five years has a meaningfully different total cost than the same loan at Prime + 3% over seven years, even if the monthly payment on the longer term feels easier. Match the amortization to the recovery curve of the use of funds. Equipment that produces revenue for five years should be financed over roughly five years, not 18 months — financing it short forces the business to absorb the full cost on its operating cash flow before the asset has finished paying for itself.',

    introduction:
      'Equipment financing and a sale-leaseback both use equipment as the collateral story, but they solve opposite problems. Equipment financing funds a new purchase — the lender advances against the cost of the asset you are about to acquire, you pay it back over 3–7 years, and at the end of the term you own the equipment free and clear. The use of funds is forward-looking: you are buying something to produce revenue.\n\nA sale-leaseback is the reverse mechanic on equipment you already own. The lender buys the equipment from you (at a percentage of its fair-market or liquidation value), then immediately leases it back to you. You keep using the equipment exactly the same way; what changed is the cash. The equity that was trapped in the asset is now in your operating account, available as working capital, and you have lease payments over the next 3–4 years instead of an owned asset on the balance sheet. The use of funds is the cash you extract: payroll, growth investment, debt consolidation, whatever the operating business needs.\n\nThe short decision: if the question is "how do I pay for new equipment," it is equipment financing. If the question is "I have free-and-clear equipment but I need cash for the operating business," it is a sale-leaseback. The two products are not substitutes; they are different answers to different questions, even though they share the same collateral type.',

        'Pick equipment financing when you are acquiring new equipment that will produce revenue. The math is straightforward: the lender advances 70%–85% of the cost of the asset, you pay roughly 15%–30% down (sometimes nothing, depending on credit and asset class), and the loan amortizes over the useful life of the equipment — most commonly 60–84 months. At the end of the term you own the equipment outright and have built a track record with the equipment lender that makes the next purchase faster.\n\nThe right comparison to make here is not equipment financing versus a sale-leaseback, but equipment financing versus drawing on your working-capital line to fund the purchase. Equipment financing is almost always cheaper for the same purchase because the lender has a specific asset to collateralize and a longer amortization to spread the payment across. Drawing on a revolver to buy a $400K machine costs you the line\'s interest rate on the full balance plus the opportunity cost of having the line tied up; financing it directly typically prices three to five points lower and matches the payment to the asset\'s useful life.',

The equipment is doing its job; you are not selling it because you do not need it. You are selling it because the cash value is currently locked inside the asset and you want to deploy that cash for something the operating business needs more: payroll during a growth period, debt consolidation, working capital, a strategic acquisition.\n\nThe trade-off is that you turn an owned asset into a lease obligation. You still get to use the equipment exactly the same way — most sale-leaseback structures include a buyout option at the end of the lease so you can re-own the equipment — but for the duration of the lease you have a fixed monthly payment that did not exist before. The discipline this requires is matching the use of the freed-up cash to a clear payback. If you sale-leaseback $300K of equipment to fund a six-month inventory build that produces $400K of margin, the math works.

The new asset is on the balance sheet matched against the new debt; the working-capital line is untouched.\n\nSale-leaseback path (the existing equipment): $600K of fair-market value, advance at 60% = $360K of cash released to the operating business.
