# LinkedIn Posts vs Website Content - SEO Keyword Gap Analysis
**Analysis Date:** December 6, 2025  
**Objective:** Identify high-value keywords/phrases from LinkedIn posts that are missing or underutilized on the website

## SECTION 2: LINKEDIN LANGUAGE vs. WEBSITE LANGUAGE

### What LinkedIn Does Well (That Website Doesn't)

| **LinkedIn Language** | **Website Language** | **Why LinkedIn Wins** |
|----------------------|---------------------|---------------------|
| "Sometimes a single decision protects an entire season" | "Need Business Growth Capital?" | Emotional, story-driven |
| "hit a cash flow wall" | "Inconsistent cash flow" | Vivid, urgent |
| "time isn't just money - it's team trust" | Generic descriptions | Emotional stakes |
| "Creative Capital Solution" | "Funding Solutions" | More memorable, differentiating |
| "Fast, Flexible Funding from Your Invoices" | "Invoice (AR) Financing" | Benefit-driven headline |
| "Situational Capital That Saved a Wedding Season" | Case study titles missing | Story-driven, memorable |
| "Trust-Based Relationships Matter" | "Trusted" | More specific, relational |
| "Capital Should Enable, Not Limit" | Generic | Philosophy-driven |
| "We leverage relationships with lenders we've worked with for years" | Generic trust messaging | Specific proof point |

---

## SECTION 3: KEYWORD DENSITY COMPARISON

### Keywords YOU USE on LinkedIn But NOT Enough on Website:

| **Keyword/Phrase** | **LinkedIn Frequency** | **Website Frequency** | **Gap** |
|-------------------|------------------------|----------------------|---------|
| "Trusted advisor" | 7 instances | 2 instances (Partners page only) | ❌ Huge gap |
| "Strategic partner" | 5 instances | 0 instances | ❌ Missing entirely |
| "Relationship-based" | 6 instances | 1 instance | ❌ Underutilized |
| "Servant leadership" | 4 instances | 2 instances (About page buried) | ❌ Not prominent |
| "Creative working capital" | 8 instances | 4 instances (good but can increase) | ⚠️ Moderate |
| "Channel-neutral" | 2 instances | 1 instance (FAQ only) | ❌ Not prominent |
| "Boutique" | 2 instances | 1 instance (About page) | ❌ Underutilized |
| "Here to Serve" | Hashtag in 6+ posts | 1 instance (homepage tagline) | ❌ Not emphasized |

---

## SECTION 4: CASE STUDY LANGUAGE GAPS

Your LinkedIn posts feature **specific, memorable case study titles** that don't exist on website:

### LinkedIn Case Study Titles (Strong SEO & Storytelling)
1. ✅ "Situational Capital That Saved a Wedding Season"
2. ✅ "$150K in 3 Days: Payroll Saved by PEO Partnership"
3. ✅ "$1MM PO Financing for International Coffee Trader"
4. ✅ "Growing From $3MM to $5MM With Capital Built to Scale"
5. ✅ "Debt Refinance + Fresh Liquidity for 22-Year Manufacturer"

### Website Case Study Section
- ⚠️ Exists at `/fundings` but titles are generic:
  - "Wedding Venue Payroll Crisis" (okay)
  - "Fast Payroll Cover" (generic)
  - No case study for coffee trader
  - No case study for 22-year manufacturer

**Opportunity:** Use LinkedIn case study language on website for better SEO and storytelling.

---

## SECTION 5: MISSING "PROBLEM-SOLUTION" LANGUAGE

### LinkedIn Uses Problem → Solution Framework Extensively:

**Example 1:**
- **Problem:** "Unpaid invoices are dormant cash"
- **Solution:** "Turn them into immediate working capital"

**Example 2:**
- **Problem:** "Their growth was outpacing their working capital"
- **Solution:** "$1MM Purchase Order facility"

**Example 3:**
- **Problem:** "an unexpected delay in a major receivable threatened to impact payroll"
- **Solution:** "$150K term loan in 4 business days"

### Website Language:
- ⚠️ Mostly feature-based, not problem-solution driven
- Homepage lists solutions but doesn't lead with problems

**Opportunity:** Restructure homepage and solution pages to lead with problems, then solutions.

---

## SECTION 6: EMOTIONAL/RELATIONAL KEYWORDS MISSING

LinkedIn posts emphasize **emotional and relational language** that builds trust:

| **LinkedIn Language** | **Website Coverage** | **Impact** |
|---------------------|---------------------|----------|
| "your reputation goes with it" | ❌ Not used | Trust-building for referral sources |
| "deepening trust" | ❌ Not used | Relationship emphasis |
| "strengthen your relationship" | ❌ Not used | Partner-focused benefit |
| "protect your best interests" | ✅ Used once on homepage | Good but not repeated |
| "we fight hard to negotiate" | ❌ Not used | Advocacy language |
| "vouched for the client" | ❌ Not used | Personal commitment |
| "built on years of doing right by clients" | ❌ Not used | Long-term relationship proof |

**Opportunity:** Add emotional/relational language throughout website to mirror LinkedIn tone.

---

## SECTION 7: COMPETITOR DIFFERENTIATION LANGUAGE

### LinkedIn Explicitly Differentiates from Competitors:

**LinkedIn Language:**
- "Relationships > Bots"
- "We partner with you — not just your application"
- "Not a lender—we're your advocate"
- "We're not limited by a single lender's 'credit box'"
- "Tired of automated platforms and generic funding advice?"

**Website Language:**
- ⚠️ "Relationships Over Bots" is on About page but NOT home page hero
- ❌ No explicit mention of "automated platforms" or "fintech" as competitors
- ✅ "We're not a lender" in FAQ (good)

**Opportunity:** Make competitor differentiation MORE PROMINENT on homepage hero section.

---

## SECTION 8: SPEED & URGENCY MESSAGING

### LinkedIn Emphasizes Speed Heavily:

**LinkedIn Language:**
- "in just 3 days"
- "Within four business days"
- "24-48 hours" (factoring)
- "10-20 business days" (ABL)
- "Fast setup: Get the facility operational in as little as two weeks"
- "often faster"

**Website Language:**
- ⚠️ Mentions speed in solutions.ts data but NOT prominently on homepage
- ❌ Homepage hero doesn't emphasize speed as core differentiator

**Opportunity:** Add speed messaging to homepage hero and value propositions.

---

## SECTION 9: REFERRAL SOURCE LANGUAGE (Bankers, CPAs, etc.)

### LinkedIn Speaks Directly to Referral Sources:

**LinkedIn Language:**
- "Commercial Banking Partners"
- "when you refer a client to a partner, a little part of your reputation goes with it"
- "Bankers are our primary referral sources"
- "Fractional CFO"
- "Business Advisor"
- "you become the advisor who has solutions"

**Website Language:**
- ✅ Partners page exists and is strong
- ❌ Home page does NOT speak to referral sources
- ❌ No homepage CTA for "Bankers & Advisors"

**Opportunity:** Add referral source CTA on homepage (dual audience: business owners + their advisors).

---
