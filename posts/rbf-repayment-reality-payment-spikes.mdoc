## The Promise vs. The Reality

You're evaluating revenue-based financing. The pitch sounds perfect: "Pay back a percentage of your revenue. When revenue is down, payments are down. When revenue is up, you can afford higher payments."

It sounds like financial breathing room.

Then you experience your first successful month. Revenue jumps 40%. And instead of breathing room, you're paying more to your capital provider than any month before.

This is the RBF trap that business owners don't talk about until it's too late.

## How RBF Repayment Actually Works

Let's be specific. You take a $100K RBF advance at 10% of monthly revenue (a typical rate). Here's what that means:

**The Math:**
- Month 1: $50K revenue → $5K payment
- Month 2: $60K revenue → $6K payment
- Month 3: $120K revenue (big month!) → $12K payment
- Month 4: $80K revenue (normal month) → $8K payment
- Month 5: $150K revenue (best month yet) → $15K payment

You feel successful. Revenue is growing. But your fixed obligations—payroll, rent, inventory—haven't changed. Suddenly, a 30% revenue jump means a 30% payment jump, right when you need cash to reinvest in growth.

{% callout type="warning" title="The Hidden Payment Spike Problem" %}
Unlike term loans (fixed $X/month), RBF payments rise AND fall with revenue. This creates two problems:
1. **High-revenue months feel like a financial trap** – You want to celebrate the win, but capital repayment takes the prize money
2. **Cash flow planning becomes impossible** – You can't budget "payment will be $8K" because it fluctuates 30-50% month to month
{% /callout %}

## Why This Happens

RBF lenders price the advance assuming YOU benefit from revenue growth. The logic: "If your revenue doubled, you can afford to pay us 10% of that doubled revenue."

It's mathematically sound from their perspective. But it ignores a critical business reality.

### The Cash Flow Gap

When revenue grows, you need that incremental cash for:
- Scaling inventory (for retail/e-commerce)
- Hiring more team (for services/staffing)
- Marketing to maintain growth momentum
- Buffer for unexpected expenses

**The irony:** RBF repayment goes UP exactly when you need cash most—during growth phases.

Compare this to a term loan:

### Term Loan vs. RBF: Same $100K, Different Cash Flow

**Scenario: Your business grows from $50K to $150K monthly revenue over 8 months**

**With a $100K Term Loan (24-month, $4,250/month fixed):**
- Month 1: $50K revenue, $4,250 payment = 8.5% of revenue
- Month 3: $120K revenue, $4,250 payment = 3.5% of revenue
- Month 8: $150K revenue, $4,250 payment = 2.8% of revenue

**Your payment burden DECREASES as you grow.** Perfect for scaling.

**With $100K RBF at 10% of revenue:**
- Month 1: $50K revenue, $5,000 payment = 10% of revenue
- Month 3: $120K revenue, $12,000 payment = 10% of revenue
- Month 8: $150K revenue, $15,000 payment = 10% of revenue

**Your payment burden STAYS THE SAME** (10% of revenue). But your absolute payment doubles.

## When the RBF Trap Springs

The real problem emerges when you hit seasonal or cyclical peaks:

### E-commerce Business: Q4 Peak

Your normal monthly revenue: $80K
Q4 monthly revenue: $200K (holiday season)

- September-November: $8K payment each month = easy
- December: $20K payment = you need that cash to buy January inventory
- January: Back to $8K payment

You survived December, but you're still stretching to fund inventory for Q1.

### SaaS Business: Sales Influx

Monthly revenue: $100K (steady)
Land 3 large contracts: $250K that month

- Normal months: $10K payment
- Contract month: $25K payment

You acquired $150K in new MRR, but $25K in new payment obligations hit the same month. Your cash position just worsened right when you should be celebrating.

### Services Business: Variable Project Work

You operate on project cycles. Some months: $60K. Other months: $150K.

With RBF at 10%:
- $60K month = $6K payment
- $150K month = $15K payment

Your revenue is unpredictable. Your payments are also unpredictable. Neither helps with cash flow planning.

{% callout type="info" title="The Payment Volatility Problem" %}
RBF creates a disconnect: You want revenue to grow (obviously), but growth creates immediate payment obligations that consume the incremental profit you just earned. This is the opposite of what you need during scaling.

## The Mental Math That Breaks Down

Here's what people think when choosing RBF:

> "Flexible payments are better than fixed payments. When things are slow, I pay less."

The reality:

> "When things are slow, I pay less. But when things are great, I pay so much that I can't invest in growth. And slow months still come around, but now I have less runway."

You get the downside flexibility (lower payments in slow months), but you also get the upside penalty (higher payments in good months). It's designed for the lender's benefit, not yours.

## When RBF Actually Makes Sense

This doesn't mean RBF is always bad. It makes sense in specific scenarios:

### RBF is Good When:

**1. Revenue is truly unpredictable AND you have low operational leverage**

Example: Consulting firm with variable project work, but low payroll/overhead.
- Your costs don't scale with revenue
- You're not reinvesting revenue into inventory or hiring
- You need short-term capital without fixed obligations

**2. You're explicitly NOT planning to grow**

Example: Steady-state service business that wants to maintain current size.
- You're OK with $80-100K monthly revenue
- You don't want to scale
- You just need a cash bridge for 12 months

**3. Predictable revenue (despite what you might think)**

Example: SaaS company with stable MRR + churn rate you understand.
- Your revenue is boring and predictable
- You know payment obligations month-ahead
- You have a product that generates consistent, recurring revenue

## When RBF is a Bad Fit

### RBF is Bad When:

**1. You're growing (or planning to)**

Fixed payment obligations are BETTER during growth. You want the payment burden to shrink as revenue grows, not stay the same percentage.

**2. Revenue is volatile (not seasonal)**

You need predictability. RBF gives you the opposite.

**3. You need growth capital**

Growth requires reinvestment. RBF consumes that reinvestment capital. Choose a structure that lets you keep growth revenue.

**4. You have variable costs tied to revenue**

If your costs scale with revenue (inventory, packaging, commissions), RBF payments can't scale against those costs. You get squeezed.

## The Right Questions Before Choosing RBF

Before you commit to RBF, ask your lender:

**1. "Walk me through a month-by-month scenario where my revenue grows 40% and then drops back. What are my payment obligations?"**

- Listen for clarity. If they dance around this, move on.

**2. "Show me the months where I'll be paying the most. When are those?"**

- If the answer is "during your best revenue months," that's the trap.

**3. "What happens to my payment obligation if I have one great month? Does it jump back down next month?"**

- Understand the volatility YOU'LL EXPERIENCE, not the average.

**4. "Can I negotiate payment caps during growth months?"**

- Most RBF lenders say no. Some say yes. The answer matters.

**5. "Is there a prepayment option if I want to exit during a good month?"**

- You want to be able to exit the relationship without being locked in.

## The Better Alternative: Term Loans (When Growth Matters)

If you're planning to scale:

**24-month term loan: $100K at 8% APR**
- Fixed payment: $4,610/month
- Year 1: Payment burden decreases as revenue grows
- Year 2: Even more cushion
- You control growth capital, not the lender

**RBF (10% of revenue):**
- Variable payment: 10% of whatever you earn
- Year 1: Payment burden STAYS 10% no matter how fast you grow
- Year 2: Same problem
- Lender benefits from your growth, not you

If you're going to grow, term loans align incentives better. You keep your incremental revenue. The lender gets a fixed return.

{% callout type="tip" title="When to Choose Each Option" %}
**Choose RBF if:** Revenue is unpredictable, you're not growing fast, and you need short-term flexibility (6-12 months).

**Choose Term Loans if:** You're scaling, revenue is growing, and you need predictability plus capital efficiency.

**Choose Asset-Based Lending if:** You have inventory or receivables you can leverage without limiting your growth capital.

## Key Takeaways

1. **RBF "flexible payments" are a misnomer** – They're flexible downward in slow months, but rigid upward in good months. That's a penalty, not flexibility.

2. **Payment spikes hit at the worst time** – When you're celebrating growth, you're writing bigger checks to your capital provider.

3. **The real cost of RBF isn't the APR** – It's the opportunity cost. Growth capital goes to repayment, not reinvestment.

4. **RBF works for non-growing businesses** – If you're steady-state and need a 12-month bridge, it's fine. If you're scaling, it works against you.

5. **Ask specific scenarios before committing** – Don't accept vague answers about "flexible payments." Run month-by-month models with your lender.

RBF isn't a trap if you understand what you're buying. But it IS a trap if you think "flexible payments = better for growth." They're not. Growth needs capital protection, not payment volatility.

Choose the structure that lets you keep your growth.
