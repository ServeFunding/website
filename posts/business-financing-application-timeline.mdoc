## The Question That Matters Most

## Scenario 1: Fast-Track Financing (1 Day to 1 Week)

### What You Need to Provide

→ 3–6 months of recent bank statements

→ One-page application (10 minutes to complete)

→ Basic business information and owner details

### What Happens Next

You submit today. You get an answer within a day or two. If approved, you can be funded within days, sometimes within a week.

### How It Gets Structured

These facilities come in two flavors:

→ Lines of credit: Flexible. Draw what you need, when you need it. Pay back as customers pay.

→ Term products: Fixed amount. Fixed term. Deploy once, repay on schedule.

### The Size

Facilities can range from $50,000 to several million—even up to $10MM depending on the lender and your specific situation.

## Scenario 2: Asset-Based Lending (4–8 Weeks)

For businesses with substantial assets—accounts receivable, inventory, equipment, real estate—asset-based lending is the answer. The process is more thorough, but the capital available is substantially larger.

### What You Need to Provide

→ Complete financial statements (recent and historical)

→ Tax returns (usually 2–3 years)

→ Detailed list of assets with values

→ Breakdown of personal finances (likely)

→ Appraisals or asset inspections (may be required)

### What Happens Next

### Timeline Expectations

→ 4–6 weeks if everything is clean and straightforward

→ 6–8 weeks if there are complications or they need additional documentation

### The Upside

You get substantial capital. You get fixed rates. You get predictable terms. And because the loan is backed by real assets, you typically get better pricing than unsecured facilities.

## Scenario 3: SBA Loans (8–12 Weeks or More)

For businesses seeking the lowest possible rates and longest possible terms, SBA loans are valuable. But they require patience.

### What You Need to Provide

→ Full business plan and personal financial statement

→ Extensive financial documentation (multiple years)

→ Detailed use of funds explanation

→ Collateral documentation

### What Happens Next

### Timeline Expectations

→ 2–3 months is standard (not unusual)

→ 4+ months if there are complications or questions that need clarification

### The Value Proposition

You get the lowest possible interest rates. You get long terms (up to 10 years). You get the backing of a federal guarantee. But you need patience and preparation.

## Why The Differences?

The simple answer: faster funding requires different evaluation criteria. Fast-track lenders rely on behavioral data (your bank statements, your recent transactions). Asset-based lenders need appraisals and detailed collateral analysis. SBA lenders need compliance with federal programs.

## Which Path Is Right For You?

Need capital in days? → Fast-track revenue-based options

Have 4–8 weeks and substantial assets? → Asset-based lending

Can wait 2–3 months for the best rate? → SBA lending

Each has tradeoffs. Speed vs rate. Flexibility vs predictability. Our job is helping you understand those tradeoffs and pick the right solution for your specific situation.
