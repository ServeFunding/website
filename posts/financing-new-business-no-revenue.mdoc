## The Question We Hear From Founders

Short answer: Yes. You can. There are options.

Long answer: Are they limited? Are they difficult to find? Yes, for sure. Especially the no-revenue scenario. But they exist, and understanding them can be the difference between growth and being stuck.

## The No-Revenue Challenge

### When No Revenue Becomes Financeable

If you have a signed contract or a purchase order in place, even with zero revenue, those can potentially be financed. Lenders can work with:

→ Signed contracts for future delivery (binding agreements)

→ Purchase orders from creditworthy customers

→ Letters of intent from solid companies that represent real future revenue

This is called contract financing or PO financing, and it can unlock substantial capital even when you have zero historical revenue.

## The Personal Asset Strategy

→ Equity in your home

→ Other real estate or valuable assets

→ Personal investments or savings ready to deploy

These personal assets can be used to help you get your business off the ground—potentially as collateral in a secured lending capacity.

## The Less-Than-One-Year Sweet Spot

Absolutely, there are options for you:

### Revenue-Based Financing

Pay back based on your actual sales growth. Some lenders will advance capital against your projected revenue if your trajectory is clear and your business model is sound.

### Asset-Based Lending

If you have equipment, inventory, or accounts receivable, even as a young company, those are real assets that can be financed.

### Contract / PO Financing

If you have customer agreements or orders in place, those can be financed to help you fulfill them.

All of these are real options for businesses under one year old with some revenue. We work with lenders that specialize in exactly this scenario.

## The Reality of Early-Stage Funding

→ What assets you have to work with (personal assets, business assets, collateral)

When you get all of that on the table, lenders who specialize in early-stage companies can actually see a fundable deal.

## Your Next Move

→ With zero revenue but a signed contract? Absolutely. Talk to us.

→ With less than a year in business and some revenue? Multiple options are available.

We are, of course, here to serve.
