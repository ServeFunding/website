## The Question Every Business Owner Under Pressure Asks

"How fast can I get funding?"

We hear it constantly. And when we do, we know exactly what's happening: there's pressure. A payroll deadline looming. A time-sensitive opportunity to close a new customer. Inventory that needs to be purchased before a critical season. A contract that's ready to move—but only if you have capital today, not in 30 days.

The urgency is real. The question is natural. But here's what many business owners don't realize:

**Speed, cost, and quality form a three-legged stool. You can optimize two, but rarely all three.**

## Understanding the Three-Legged Stool

Think about any capital project—manufacturing, construction, or in this case, funding. Three variables define the outcome:

### 1. **Speed** – How quickly do you close?
- Days to a week (fast)
- 2-3 weeks (moderate)
- 30+ days (slow)

### 2. **Cost** – What does the capital actually cost?
- Interest rates
- Fees and origination costs
- Hidden costs in the structure (prepayment penalties, yield maintenance, etc.)

### 3. **Quality** – Does the funding help your business or stress it?
- Do payments fit your actual cash flow?
- Is the structure flexible if circumstances change?
- Does it create risk for your business down the road?

The uncomfortable truth: **Fast money is almost always more expensive money.** And **cheap money usually takes more time.**

## Real Examples: What the Tradeoff Looks Like

### The Event Venue: Balancing Speed and Quality

A high-end event venue in the Southeast serves 60–70% of their annual revenue in Q4—a seasonal concentration that creates massive cash flow strain. The client needed $300K for peak-season operations, but their existing bank had to decline because of historical losses tied to seasonality.

**The tradeoff they faced:**
- They could get fast, expensive capital (asset-based lending, higher rates, short terms)
- They could wait 4–6 weeks for cheap capital from a traditional term loan

**The solution:** A $300K term loan with a 22-month payment schedule and 100% of remaining interest waived on prepayment. They got speed (closed in under a week), manageable cost, and quality structure—because payments were designed to fit cash flow during and after the busy season.

They didn't compromise on all three. But they got two that mattered most.

## The Three Common Scenarios

### Scenario 1: Speed + Cost (sacrifice Quality)
- You get capital fast (3–5 days) at competitive rates
- But payments are rigid; they don't fit your cash flow
- Result: You solve today's crisis but create a new one in 90 days when cash gets tight

### Scenario 2: Cost + Quality (sacrifice Speed)
- You wait 4–6 weeks for a well-structured deal
- Payments fit your cash flow; terms are flexible
- But you've missed the sales opportunity or payroll deadline
- Result: You're disciplined, but the moment has passed

### Scenario 3: Speed + Quality (but pay for it)
- You close in days with a structure that actually works for your business
- But you pay a premium rate for the speed and custom structure
- Result: Higher cost, but you keep the relationship and avoid financial stress

## The Better Question to Ask

When you're under pressure and need capital, don't ask:

> "How fast can I get funding?"

**Ask this instead:**

> "What am I willing to give up for that speed? And is it worth it?"

Sometimes the answer is yes. If you're closing a $2M customer contract, and you need $300K in capital for 8 weeks to fulfill it, then speed matters more than a 1% difference in rate. The tradeoff is worth it.

Other times, the answer is no. If you're funding seasonal operations and can plan 60 days ahead, waiting for a 22-month term loan with flexible payments is smarter than taking expensive bridge capital that bleeds profit every month.

Fast capital often comes with hidden costs:
- Yield maintenance clauses that punish early repayment
- Fees embedded in origination costs
- Aggressive payment schedules that ignore your actual cash flow
- Loss of negotiating power with your other lenders

Ask specifically about prepayment terms, embedded fees, and whether payments can be adjusted if cash flow changes.

## Smart Money vs. Fast Money

Here's the distinction that matters:

**Fast Money** = Capital deployed quickly, often at higher cost, with terms that may not fit your business.

**Smart Money** = Capital structured to support growth, with payments designed around your actual cash flow, and flexibility built in when circumstances change.

You want smart money. And that's where good advice—from a lending partner who takes time to understand your business—actually matters.

## Decision Framework: Which Path Is Right for You?

**Choose Speed if:**
- You have a time-sensitive opportunity (new contract, customer commitment)
- The opportunity's ROI justifies the premium cost of fast capital
- You can repay early and eliminate the higher rate quickly
- Cash flow is stable enough to absorb tighter payment schedules

**Choose Cost if:**
- Your funding need is predictable and you can plan 4–6 weeks ahead
- You have steady cash flow and can support traditional loan payments
- You want to minimize total cost over time
- You're comfortable with standard terms and conditions

**Choose Quality if:**
- Your business has seasonal patterns or variable cash flow
- You want flexibility to adjust if revenue changes
- You need a lending partner who understands your business, not just the numbers
- Long-term relationship and stability matter more than a quick close

**The reality?** Smart businesses often choose a combination. They plan ahead when possible, accept slightly higher cost for appropriate speed when necessary, and prioritize structure quality to protect themselves over time.

## Key Takeaways

1. **You can't optimize all three** – Speed, cost, and quality are constrained by each other.
2. **Fast money is expensive** – If speed is your priority, expect to pay for it.
3. **Cheap money takes time** – Traditional financing is slower but more affordable.
4. **Quality matters most** – The best deal is one structured to actually support your business, not strain it.
5. **Ask the right question** – Instead of "how fast?" ask "what am I willing to trade?"

The goal is never just to get money fast. **The goal is to get smart money—capital that solves today's problem without creating tomorrow's crisis.**
