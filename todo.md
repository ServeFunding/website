Thank you! On my phone the photos on the homepage are not fully visible. They are truncated. Maybe need to check the mobile view. 


Just tried to challenge the bot, got a pretty good answer (overall) but there’s some tweaks me to make. 

For one thing - we DO charge upfront fees, LOL.. so we should probably address that part, 

but otherwise it’s a pretty strong answer, I would also add just anything that emphasizes always putting the needs of the client - and their best interests - above our own .. Something along those lines - but overall pretty good answer!
