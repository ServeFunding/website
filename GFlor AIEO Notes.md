How to Get Your Site Into ChatGPT (Even If Nobody’s 100% Sure How It Works Yet)
ChatGPT uses Bing’s search index to find and suggest websites. If you want to show up in GPT answers, start optimizing for Bing—not Google. It's an emerging opportunity, still poorly understood.

A few months ago, someone on Reddit dropped a hot take:

“If you want your site to show up in ChatGPT, optimize for Bing.”

And at first glance, it sounded like your usual SEO conspiracy theory. But I started digging—and turns out, this may be one of the biggest overlooked growth channels right now.

Founders are getting leads from GPT. People are discovering SaaS tools, services, even potential acquisitions directly from AI suggestions. And there’s no “official” playbook for this… yet.

So I decided to research everything I could find.

Here’s what I learned.

(PS, Product Market Fit newsletter appeared for me on ChatGPT, can you check if it also does to you?)




🧠 Why ChatGPT Suggests Some Sites and Not Others
It turns out GPT-4 (especially Turbo, the paid version) can access live web results through Bing’s search index. So, no—GPT doesn’t just “remember” the internet from 2023. It fetches fresh results through Bing, ranks them internally, and summarizes them in natural language.

But AI search isn’t just “old-school SEO with a twist.” It’s its own thing. Here’s what seems to matter most:

1. Bing > Google for GPT Visibility
Google or Bing (or Both?) Which PPC Network is Worth Your Time and Money


GPT uses Bing. So even if you rank #1 on Google, you might be invisible to GPT users. Bing uses:

More humans-in-the-loop to evaluate sites.

A heavier weight on on-page SEO (like Google did in 2015).

Preference for high intent, long-tail queries.

💡 Try optimizing for keywords like:

“best CRM for small nonprofits”

“SaaS tools for legal teams under 50 employees”

These convert better and perform better on Bing.

What’s an LLM and how they work

📚 What Actually Works (From People Who’ve Done It)
There are a few founders who’ve tested this out in the wild. Here’s what they say is working:

🏗 Add Schema Markup (Especially FAQs)
One founder added FAQs to just 3 high-intent pages and started showing up in GPT responses within 48 hours. That’s unheard of in SEO timelines.

🔗 Internal Linking Over Backlinks
For Google, backlinks are king. For GPT? Internal linking seems to matter more. One agency built recursive loops between blog posts, guides, and landing pages to reinforce authority on a specific theme.

🧵 Create Thematic Content Clusters
AI models love structured info. Build your site around topics, not just keywords. One agency that wanted to be known as the “best martech SEO agency” built:

A hub page

A listicle of competitors

A technical checklist

A few Reddit and Medium posts linking back

GPT picked it up. It started appearing in AI answers. The agency booked 3–6 calls per month from GPT exposure alone.

🧪 Still Experimental (But That’s the Opportunity)
Here’s what’s not clear:

There’s no rank tracker. You won’t find a “ChatGPT SEO” tool (yet).

You can’t measure this precisely. You have to ask people how they found you, search manually, and track what changes affect visibility.

But this is where the opportunity lies: we’re in a moment where AI-generated search results are still unstructured and open.

It’s like the early Google days. Nobody knows what works—but if you test aggressively, you can win big.

💥 My Suggested Playbook
If you want to experiment with getting your startup into GPT responses, here’s a stack-ranked playbook based on what I found:

Target Bing-specific keywords: Long-tail, high-intent queries. Forget “CRM” and go for “best CRM for remote sales teams.”

Add FAQ schema to key pages: GPT loves structured data. Use Google’s Structured Data Markup Helper to speed it up.

Build topical authority:

One core landing page

3–5 related posts that link to each other

Use listicles, breakdowns, guides

Get mentioned on social Q&A platforms:

Reddit, Quora, Hacker News, Medium

GPT scrapes these and seems to use them for entity validation

Monitor GPT manually:

Search queries in ChatGPT like:
“Best tools for [problem your startup solves]”
“Top alternatives to [category you’re in]”

Track mentions, screenshots, and ask leads how they found you.

📣 Let’s Crowdsource This Together
Nobody knows the full answer yet. But this feels like one of those rare early-stage channels that might explode.

If you’re experimenting with AI search optimization—or have tips, success stories, or failures—drop them in the comments. I’ll feature the best insights in a future issue.

We’re still early. Let’s build the playbook together 🔥

I just gave Bing Copilot the same prompt (in the UK) and it returned IndieHackers, ProductHunt, Founder Insights, The Hustle and Failory. One would assume that Copilot relies heavily on Bing’s rankings too. Can anyone explain the lack of alignment with ChatGPT?

I asked DeepSeek (free version), which listed 18 newsletters (not including PMF) across 7 categories.

For good measure I asked Gemini, which listed 10 (not including PMF) across 3 categories.

It feels as though AI search optimisation (AISO?) is going to be an order of magnitude tougher to crack than ‘old fashioned’ SEO. Time to invest in a bunch of new martech and website app tooling.
